"2012 LAND GRANT AND SEA GRANT NATIONAL WATER CONFERENCE Portland, OR Wed May 23 rd , Session: R4. Innovative Management Managing the ""Shale Gale"" within the goal of water resource sustainability: A case study of unconventional shale gas development and water resource management",2012,"The recent explosion of shale oil and gas development throughout the US and abroad has shaken the water resource community, some believe, like no other activity in its history. As activities of this significant unconventional energy resource rapidly moves forward it is important that the consequences of its development be assessed so that its roll and impact within the more traditional water resource community is fully understood. A knowledge gap about the energy resource/technology and its impact on water resources exist because most information is being provided by sources with minimal knowledge of the industry and/or the water resource community. Formed in 2001 as a Louisiana State University System Institute, the Red River Watershed Management Institute at Shreveport addresses issues that concern the quality and availability of water for the public, agriculture, industry, and ecosystems in the watersheds of the Red River Basin in Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas. The Institute ended up in the ""eye"" of the ""Shale Gale"" during this new industry's formative stage (Haynesville shale gas ""play"" with its significant water requirements) and has taken that opportunity to develop and utilize unique cooperative adaptive management approaches to find solutions that are being applied to water resource management well beyond this region. The 'Haynesville model' is based on utilizing sound science to establish water resource need and availability (monitoring wells/water quality studies), but just as important is the establishment of pragmatic and sustainable venues where local, state and federal agencies are brought together with industry operators to establish adaptive approaches and, if need be, new legislation (Louisiana) to plan for and implement fair utilization of regional surface and groundwater resources. For it is only through development and communication of this tacit knowledge that solutions flow. An update of emerging plays, hydraulic fracturing and ""waterless"" fracturing will be discussed."
Across the universe of shale resources-a comparative assessment of the emerging legal foundations for unconventional energy,2018,"Outside the US, the commercial development of shale gas and oil will need to overcome significant legal and regulatory challenges if it is ever to take off. This study identifies several key features that have contributed to shale’s economic success in the US and applies them to three country settings where policy decisions have been taken to advance a shale resources agenda: Argentina, Colombia and the United Kingdom. Each country is at an initial stage in the development of its resources and has explored various legal instruments to advance its policy aims. In reviewing their experiences, we may be able to identify the emergence of a dedicated body of good or best practices. The study confirms that governments tend initially to rely heavily on established hydrocarbons regulatory approaches, where they exist, but that these quickly prove fragile or insufficient, and need to be supplemented by new measures and institutions targeted specifically at meeting the challenges arising from ownership, infrastructure (including local content) and consent which may otherwise inhibit investment in this energy sector."
Adoption of legislation on shale gas in france: Hesitation and/or progress.,2013,"This paper provides a chronological account of the eventful adoption of France's first law on shale gas. This governance issue calls into question the implementation of environmental principles, such as the principles of prevention, public information and participation, which were constitutionalized in the 2005 Environmental Charter. The hesitations of the French government illustrate the management difficulties at the state level with regards to new unconventional hydrocarbons that have a particular impact on the environment. On 13th July 2011, the legislator adopted a law that prohibited the use of hydraulic fracturing for the prospection of shale gas and oil. Although this represents a world first, it was designed hastily and has failed to satisfy any of the stakeholders involved. We examine the chronology of events, with particular focus on the chaotic governmental and legislative responses to public pressure on an unprecedented scale."
An analysis of the challenges for groundwater governance during shale gas development in South Africa,2016,"As a prelude to potential development of South Africa’s shale gas resources, it is critical to develop and implement effective groundwater governance arrangements. Existing policies and plans were analysed to determine whether critical gaps or barriers exist that could potentially lead to impacts on groundwater systems. Ten high-priority governance challenges were identified: (a) defining relevant metrics for baseline groundwater quality and availability; (b) developing guidelines for shale gas resource licensing, exploration, drilling, extraction, production, and completion; (c) defining and enforcing compliance monitoring systems; (d) dealing punitively with non-compliant operators; (e) mitigating and managing risks to prevent impairment of groundwater resources; (f) implementing a goal-based regulatory framework; g) enforcing strict chemical disclosure requirements; (h) coordinating across government departments and regulatory bodies meaningfully and productively; (i) implementing a framework for subsidiarity and support to local water management; and (j) providing an incentive framework that supports strong groundwater management and environmental protection. To overcome these challenges, it is recommended that a decentralised, polycentric, bottom-up approach involving multiple institutions is developed to adaptively manage shale gas development. This transition from the current rigid regulatory structure can foster cooperation and collaboration among key stakeholders. The use of a pro-active groundwater governance structure that can accommodate current, near-term, and long-term shale gas development is important for ensuring that future energy development in South Africa incorporates the influence of other simultaneous stressors such as climate (e.g. drought), landuse changes, population growth, industry, and competing demands for water.

Assessing the existing knowledge base and opinions of decision makers on the regulation and monitoring of unconventional gas mining in South Africa,2013,"A policy vacuum exists in relation to the exploration and mining of unconventional gas in South Africa, with a recent survey showing that 86% of the respondents did not know what hydraulic fracturing entails. We conducted a study to determine the opinion of decision makers involved in formulating policy and regulating mining activities related to shale gas mining in South Africa, as this was not covered in the aforementioned survey. Our results demonstrate that the regulation of shale gas mining in South Africa is viewed as extremely important and identifies possible regulatory and monitoring tools to assist in governing this activity."
Brexit and Article 50 of the Treaty of the European Union: Implications for UK Energy Policy and Security,2017,"This paper articulates the potential implications of Brexit on energy policy and security in the United Kingdom (UK). Given the uncertainties associated with the decision to leave the European Union (EU), the need to consider its potential effects on the UK’s energy sector becomes even more pertinent. Through the lens of a few widely reviewed trade regimes in the light of Brexit, it can be observed that while UK energy policies are unlikely to change drastically, Brexit nevertheless threatens the UK’s capacity to safeguard its energy supply. The uncertainties following Brexit could arguably starve the UK’s upstream petroleum, electricity, and renewable energy sectors of their required investments. Both short and long-term impacts could result in UK residents paying more per unit of energy consumed in a “hard Brexit” scenario, where the UK exits the Internal Energy Market (IEM) and must trade with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules. While a hard Brexit could aid the growth of the nascent shale gas industry, a negotiated withdrawal that includes some form of access to the IEM (a “soft Brexit”) would be more beneficial for the future of energy security in the UK."
Butler v. Charles Powers Estate Superior Court Decision Causes Uncertainty with Unconventional Gas Leases,2011,"The Superior Court’s decision in Butler v. Charles Powers Estate is causing some uncertainty with respect to the validity of certain natural gas leases in Pennsylvania’s Marcellus Shale region. The issue before the court involved disputed ownership of the natural gas in the Marcellus Shale (and by implication, other unconventional natural gas plays in Pennsylvania). An 1881 deed reserved to Charles Powers, his heirs and assigns, one half the “minerals and Petroleum Oils” beneath the land. The Butlers brought a quite title action against the heirs seeking ownership of the reserved “minerals and petroleum oils” based on adverse possession. The trial court, citing the Dunham Rule, dismissed with prejudice the heirs’ request for a declaratory judgment that the reservation in the deed reserved to the heirs one-half ownership of the natural gas trapped within the Marcellus Shale on the basis that the deed did not specifically reference natural gas. The Superior Court reversed and remanded, reasoning that the Dunham Rule does not end the analysis, absent a more sufficient understanding of whether, among other things: (1) Marcellus Shale constitutes a “mineral”; (2) Marcellus Shale gas constitutes the type of conventional natural gas contemplated in Dunham and subsequent decisions; and (3) Marcellus Shale is similar to coal to the extent that whoever owns the shale, owns the shale gas. The case was remanded to the trial court to develop the record as to whether the Marcellus Shale constitutes a type of “mineral” such that the gas trapped within the shale falls within the deed’s reservation. The Butlers filed a petition for allowance of appeal with the Pennsylvania Supreme Court on October 7, 2011."
Can the Polish shale gas dog still bark? Politics and policy of unconventional hydrocarbons in Poland☆,2016,"Abstract The article is based on a throughout analysis of Polish and Western debate on shale gas as well as on interviews with key Polish experts and policymakers, and aims at reconstructing the recent history of development of shale gas in Poland and at mapping how various factors and actors have interacted in this process. Although the country’s membership in the EU makes the understanding of the EU regulatory framework important in this context, the main focus of the article is on how the issues have been addressed in Poland, the country that was believed to be best suited to become European shale gas success story. The article sheds light on how four factors – the national energy governance, social acceptance and geological conditions, combined with the Polish approach to energy security – have contributed to the process of shaping of the Polish policy on development of shale gas in a period between 2005 and 2015. By examining the question of development of unconventional energy resources in the Polish and European context this article seeks to address following questions to be covered in the special issue of the journal: • perceptions of risk and socially constructed debate on unconventional gas; • developments in individual countries (Poland) and in the EU; • national concerns about externalities; • the adequacy of current EU regulation and its reception in member states."
Comparative Politics of Sub-Federal Cap-and-Trade: Implementing the Western Climate Initiative,2015,"Why have only two of the eleven original members of the Western Climate Initiative implemented a cap-and-trade system? This article compares the implementation of cap-and-trade in California and Quebec versus in New Mexico and British Columbia. Ideas around the reality of anthropogenic global warming and the legitimacy of cap-and-trade created favorable context in three jurisdictions, although institutions condition the expression of these ideas in the policy-making process. Since parliamentary institutions concentrate power, elite consensus is more important in Canada, while in the United States public opinion plays a more significant role. However, ideational factors shaped by political institutions do not explain differences in cap-and-trade implementation. Growth in shale gas production, welcomed in British Columbia and New Mexico but resisted by Quebec and marginal in California, further explain different outcomes. Ideas, mediated by institutions, are the necessary prerequisites for action, while mat..."
Conceptualizing the above ground factors in shale gas: Toward a research agenda on regulatory governance,2016,"Abstract Stalling progress in European, Chinese and Latin American shale has been attributed to difficult geological formations and lacking data. Yet, ‘above ground’ factors matter in the extractive industries as much as geology. It is policies, regulation and institutional settings that determines the success or failure of a contested, risk bound technology such as fracking. This article suggests that a regulatory governance agenda may offer novel insights into shale gas as a policy phenomenon. The article first provides a critical review of the existing literature on shale gas and identifies the key themes of security, social contestations and socio-economic impact. It then turns to assessing the literature on policy regimes, regulatory competition, regulatory path dependence and regulatory agencies which, it is argued, form essential elements of a research agenda for investigating unconventional gas as a regulatory governance problem. Building on these, the paper sketches focal points of investigations going forward."
Delaying decarbonization: Climate governmentalities and sociotechnical strategies from Copenhagen to Paris,2020,"Abstract An era (2005–2015) centered around the Copenhagen Accord saw the rise of several immature sociotechnical strategies currently at play: carbon capture and storage, REDD+, next-generation biofuels, shale gas, short-lived climate pollutants, carbon dioxide removal, and solar radiation management. Through a framework grounded in governmentality studies, we point out common trends in how this seemingly disparate range of strategies is emerging, evolving, and taking effect. We find that recent sociotechnical strategies reflect and reinforce governance rationalities emerging during the Copenhagen era: regime polycentrism, relative gains sought in negotiations, ‘co-benefits’ sought with other governance regimes, ‘time-buying’ or ‘bridging’ rationalities, and appeals to vulnerable demographics. However, these sociotechnical systems remain conditioned by the resilient market governmentality of the Kyoto Protocol era. Indeed, the carbon economy exercises a systemic structuring condition: While emerging climate strategies ostensibly present new tracks for signalling ambition and action, they functionally permit the delaying of comprehensive decarbonization."
Energy Security or Energy Governance? Legal and Political Aspects of Sustainable Exploration of Shale Gas in Poland.,2014,"This paper analyses prospects for an institutional structure to govern and ensure environmentally sustainable exploration of unconvent ional (shale) gas in Poland. Shale gas developments in the United States (US) ignited a widespread policy and law deba te in Europe about the prospects of emerging fuel. In Poland, the debate has developed particular ly high expectations on both the Government and the Public’s side, ascribed to future exploratio n and production of unconventional gas from shale formations. To ensure a balance between ener gy security prerogatives and resource governance responsibilities, Warsaw has sought to organise a t op-down approach to shale gas exploration in Poland with an enhanced role-playing of the Govern ment and its respective Ministries, particularly the Ministry of Environment in absence of an Energy Mini stry proper. What can be referred to as a state- centric model toward exploration of shale gas, the Polish case study evidences opportunities as well as challenges in replicating the US’s revolutionary g as production developments and it continues to have an impact on embryonic structure of energy govern ance in Poland. Utilising theories of politicisation and governance, the paper argues that the state-cen tric approach to the emerging resource may be inadequate to initiate a large-scale energy security change the country longs for. The state-centric approach and lack of a robust le gal framework may have been the ke y challenges to the rise of shale gas momentum which peaked in early 2010s. Exodus of key commercial actors from the Polish market in the last couple of years may harbinger inevita ble decline of future shale gas exploration and production as much needed financial and t echnological stimulus may be lacking."
Enhancing the energy security and governance of shale gas,2014,"Many assessments of the promise and pitfalls to shale gas development are incomplete. They tend to focus primarily on the benefits for electricity generation and gas producers, and therefore only address in a limited way the impact shale gas has on wider issues such as energy security and stewardship. We expand on the existing literature by considering a broad treatment of the energy security needs of the United States and other countries. We find that with the proper safeguards in place-public disclosure, sound water management, continuous evaluation and stakeholder engagement, selectivity ..."
Environmental Disputes and Opportunity-Threat Impacts Surrounding Natural Gas Fracking in Louisiana:,2014,"Despite the increasing socioenvironmental controversy over the use of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing technology in unconventional natural gas development (i.e., fracking), few sociological studies have used citizen interview narratives to examine attitudes toward shale fracking at the local level. Drawing on sociological research, discursive documents, and in-depth interview data collected from regional stakeholder groups/citizens, this article offers a qualitative analysis of the environmental disputes and opportunity-threat impacts perceived to surround natural gas exploration and hydraulic fracking in the Haynesville Shale region of Louisiana. The narratives reveal that the fracking dispute largely revolves around divergent diagnostic and prognostic beliefs about shale gas development, as well as whether the perceived economic opportunities of development outweigh the alleged socioenvironmental risks to the Haynesville community. Some conclusions about the utility of qualitative research ..."
Environmental Justice and Land Use Conflict: The governance of mineral and gas resource development,2017,"Conflict over the extraction of coal and gas resources has rapidly escalated in communities throughout the world. Using an environmental justice lens, this multidisciplinary book explores cases of land use conflict through the lived experiences of communities grappling with such disputes. Drawing on theories of justice and fairness in environmental decision making, it demonstrates how such land use conflicts concerning resource use can become entrenched social problems, resistant to policy and legal intervention. The author presents three case studies from New South Wales in Australia and Pennsylvania in the US of conflict concerning coal, coal gas and shale gas development. It shows how conflict has escalated in each case, exploring access to justice in land use decision making processes from the perspective of the communities at the heart of these disputes. Weaknesses in contemporary policy and regulatory frameworks, including ineffective opportunities for public participation and a lack of community recognition in land use decision making processes, are explored. The book concludes with an examination of possible procedural and institutional reforms to improve access to environmental justice and better manage cases of land use conflict. Overall, the volume links the philosophies of environmental justice with rich case study findings, offering readers further insight into both the theory and practice of land use decision making."
Fracking in a fractured environment: Shale gas mining and institutional dynamics in South Africa’s young democracy,2018,"Abstract This paper situates the question of shale gas mining in South Africa within broader debates on policy co-ordination within governmental systems. The prospect of shale gas mining has posed severe challenges for the complex inter-governmental system in South Africa. Three key Departments are affected by possible shale gas mining: Mineral Resources, Environmental Affairs and Water Resources. Each of these Departments have different relationships with the provincial and municipal ""spheres of government"". The Department of Mineral Resources has attempted to promote shale gas mining with no reference to municipalities, whereas the other two Departments have attempted to build up municipal capacity. Municipalities have key functions which are protected in the Constitution. However, many municipalities are weak institutions, unwilling to defend their powers. The paper examines Municipal Integrated Development Plans in the potential shale gas region. Most municipalities seem to have no awareness at all of the shale gas issue. Recently, a High Court ruled that any shale gas mining regulations must be made by the Department of Environmental Affairs. With its more decentralist approach to governance, it will mean that municipalities will have more opportunities to participate in shale gas mining decisions."
Fracking the Debate: Frame Shifts and Boundary Work in Dutch Decision Making on Shale Gas,2017,"The meaning of hydraulic fracturing for shale gas is contested worldwide: is it an energy game changer, a transition fuel, or a technology that poses severe environmental problems? In the Netherlands, a policy controversy developed in which fracturing was reframed from ‘business as usual’ to a potential environmental risk. This article theoretically and empirically describes this shift by arguing that the technology of hydraulic fracturing for shale gas is a boundary object that created a sphere of engagement for all sorts of actors. In this sphere, they negotiated a common but soft meaning of this technology. These negotiations consisted of frame contests. As part of those contests, the discursive strategies of framing and boundary work enabled opponents to create uncertainty about economic benefits and environmental impact. The shift in meaning transformed the issue from an economic one with standard governmental rules and regulations into a planning issue that needs more precaution."
"Fracking, Federalism, and Private Governance",2014,"The United States is in the midst of a natural gas boom, made possible by advances in drilling and extraction technologies. There is considerable disagreement about the relative benefits and costs of the boom, but one thing is certain: it has caught governments flat-footed. The federal government has done little more than commission a study of some associated public health and environmental risks. States have moved faster to address natural gas risks, but with little consistency or transparency. Numerous private organizations are beginning to fill the resulting governance gaps with information-gathering and standards-setting efforts. This Paper documents these efforts and then uses a concrete policy proposal — the development of sustainable shale gas credits — to argue that these private entities are well positioned to facilitate the development and horizontal and vertical diffusion of innovative public governance strategies. In other words, these entities are fulfilling the experimentation function once assigned to states in so-called “laboratory federalism.” The Paper ends on a cautionary note, however. Private governance efforts often suffer from a lack of openness, balance, and accountability. Worse, there is reason to fear that familiar procedural reforms aimed at fixing those problems for public agencies may work far less well in the private context."
Fractured politics? The comparative regulation of shale gas in Europe,2018,"ABSTRACTEuropean countries have developed strikingly different responses to shale gas and fracking. Some have imposed outright bans, while others have issued permits and even awarded generous tax breaks to the industry. To explain this puzzling variance, this article builds a theoretical framework that focuses on energy security, economic competitiveness, the party composition of government, public opinion, multilevel governance and democratic tradition. It then conducts a qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) of the regulation of shale gas in 16 European Union member countries. We find that the level of public concern is a sufficient condition for restrictive regulation. Other conditions only work in combination with others, while energy security and democratic tradition have no impact on the regulation of shale gas and fracking. The findings indicate that the uptake of shale gas is not simply a function of structural factors such as geology or population density, but rather the result of political factors."
Framing Shale Gas for Policy-Making in Poland,2017,"AbstractDespite enthusiasm about new gas reserves, shale gas has not come to Poland without controversies. This study examines how shale gas has been framed as a public issue by political and business elites, experts, local communities and civil society organizations. Through a frame analysis, we found three main frames about shale gas: shale gas as a novel economic resource, as a strategic resource for energy security and as a threat. However, only the first two frames, proposed by political and business elites, have shaped the policy process. The third frame, constructed by local actors and civil society groups, has had minimal impact. We explain this exclusion drawing on the deficit model of risk communication. This approach reveals that Polish experts, and business and political actors, during their interactions with local groups, have framed proponents of the threat frame as ‘incompetent actors’ effectively excluding the threat frame from policy processes."
Gas security in the land of insecurity: governance challenges of shale gas development in Mexico,2017,"This article identifies the governance challenges of shale gas development. Mexico has vast shale gas reserves and production and exploration of natural gas were liberalised after the energy reform was adopted into law in 2014. This reform established the governing system that will rule the upstream oil and gas sectors. This governing system consists of a regulatory setting composed of federal institutions that lack human resources specialising in shale development. In early 2018, the first competitive bidding process for shale fields will be conducted. The local communities have not yet been consulted and cannot fully oppose shale development in their land. The production of shale gas on a commercial scale could help Mexico achieve security of gas supply under increasing demand for gas in oil and electricity production and increasing gas imported from the United States. However, some of the largest shale reserves are located within states characterised by high levels of violent crime and increasing retur..."
Governance of Unconventional Gas in Bulgaria: From Exploration to Bust,2014,"The story of Bulgarian shale gas exemplifies the difficulty for the unconventional gas industry to take a hold in Europe. This paper investigates the reasons for Bulgaria banning shale gas by disentangling the various domestic causes at work. We find the failure of shale gas exploration to progress in Bulgaria is attributed to two main drivers: material factors such as the government's interest in staying in power; and process related drivers, notably a highly centralized politically controlled decision making structure and a flawed policy process. Central to the discussion is the alienating of local level municipalities thus making them politically resistant to national level dictates. Interestingly, the protest movement resonated in both the environmental realm and geopolitical sphere, with policy agendas partially overlapping with those of Gazprom, the dominant foreign actor in Bulgaria’s energy system. The fate of Bulgarian shale gas therefore offers broader lessons on the governance of shale gas, for Central Eastern Europe and beyond."
"Governing Shale Gas : Development, Citizen Participation and Decision Making in the US, Canada, Australia and Europe",2018,"Shale energy development is an issue of global importance. The number of reserves globally, and their potential economic return, have increased dramatically in the past decade. Questions abound, however, about the appropriate governance systems to manage the risks of unconventional oil and gas development and the ability for citizens to engage and participate in decisions regarding these systems. Stakeholder participation is essential for the social and political legitimacy of energy extraction and production, what the industry calls a 'social license' to operate. This book attempts to bring together critical themes inherent in the energy governance literature and illustrate them through cases in multiple countries, including the US, the UK, Canada, South Africa, Germany and Poland. These themes include how multiple actors and institutions – industry, governments and regulatory bodies at all scales, communities, opposition movements, and individual landowners – have roles in developing, contesting, monitoring, and enforcing practices and regulations within unconventional oil and gas development. Overall, the book proposes a systemic, participatory, community-led approach required to achieve a form of legitimacy that allows communities to derive social priorities by a process of community visioning. This book will be of great relevance to scholars and policy-makers with an interest in shale gas development, and energy policy and governance."
"Hydraulic Fracturing (Fracking), Federalism, and the Water-Energy Nexus",2013,"While the actual and potential water impacts of hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) are well-known and the subject of sometimes intense scholarly debate, few discussions to date have situated fracking within the larger legal and policy conundrum known as the water-energy nexus. This nexus acknowledges that, just as water supply and energy production are mutually dependent, so water policy and energy policy should also develop in tandem. Thus, the water-energy nexus demands that regulators view fracking’s intersections with water resources as more than “merely” an environmental law problem.Developing water policy and energy policy in tandem, however, raises federalism issues that are relevant to the United States’s increasing reliance on fracking and shale gas to supply its natural gas needs. Fracking has already been the subject of serious federalism debates, but these debates have generally focused on whether an individual state or the federal government is the more appropriate regulator of fracking and its environmental impacts — i.e., the debate has concentrated around issues of how to fit fracking into more traditional governance structures for on-shore energy development, water resource management, and environmental regulation, all of which suggest that states should be the primary regulators. Viewing fracking through the lens of the water-energy nexus, however, both adds a broader context to this federalism debate and suggests that fracking should constitute both a significant focus of and potential testing ground for the increasing federal interest in integrating water management and energy policy."
Hydraulic fracturing as an interpretive policy problem: lessons on energy controversies in Europe and the U.S.A.,2017,"ABSTRACTThis special issue addresses hydraulic fracturing for shale gas extraction as an interpretive policy problem. Bringing together empirical cases from the U.S.A., the Netherlands, the U.K., Poland, and Germany, we identify three approaches to the interpretation of hydraulic fracturing in the article: understanding its meaning, contextual explanation of the institutionalization of its meaning, and policy design as intervention to alter its meaning. By exploring differences and similarities across these cases, we identified two central tensions in the meaning of shale gas in all cases: (1) economic opportunity or environmental threat and (2) transition toward a more carbon-free energy future or perpetuation of a fossil fuel system. We found that when actors shift the meaning of hydraulic fracturing to consider it predominantly an issue of threat, this explains the dominance of risk governance as an approach to managing the controversy. Alternately, when the meaning of fracking shifts from consideratio..."
Impacts of German energy policies on the competitiveness of national energy intensive industries,2013,"The aim of this paper is to assess the impacts of German energy policies on the competitiveness of national energy intensive industries. The basic idea behind our analysis is that energy policies in Germany create a certain electricity market structure resulting in a certain electricity price, which is a major determinant for the competitiveness of energy intensive industries (e.g. chemicals, paper, aluminum, iron and steel) as energy and electricity constitute a large share in manufacturing costs. The electricity price is the outcome of supply and demand decisions of producers and consumers, with a major supply determinant being the electricity generation technology portfolio. Suboptimal investments within this portfolio are supposed to raise the electricity price and deteriorate the competitiveness of German energy intensive industries. As competitiveness is a relative concept and all world regions are connected via trade, especially in manufacturing, competitiveness occurrences in Germany have direct implications for the competitiveness of energy intensive industries in other European countries, China or the U.S. Our analysis has been motivated by the current discussion about future investment needs of large gas power plants in Germany. Currently, they are crowded out of the electricity market by extensive renewable energy promotion under the German renewable energy law (EEG). This phenomenon is known as the merit-order-effect (Sensfus et al., 2008). Though, this kind of substitution between electricity generation technologies is in part a desired outcome of that energy and climate policy. But this instant potentially affects the security-of-supply-goal of German and European energy policy, particularly in periods with a low feed-in of renewable energies (high residual load). Gas power plants, like gas turbine or combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) plants, are essentially employed in periods with a high residual load, because they are the most flexible in terms of adjusting power level (load-following), which is a valuable feature in times of fluctuating wind and solar power. However, gas power plants typically exhibit the highest marginal costs of non-renewable power plants. This poses the question whether the current energy-only market works correctly or not, i.e. whether the electricity price reflects scarcity of peak-load or load-following capacities sufficiently. If it does, investments in gas power plants are redundant, even in periods with a high residual load. If not, the marginal cost based price would be too low to cover the high investment costs (“missing money” problem). Scarcity could lead to temporary price spikes or even blackouts, if grid restrictions rule out electricity imports from other areas. In that case other mechanisms, such as capacity markets, would be needed to also remunerate capacity provision for peak-load or load-following capacities (cf. Finon & Pignon, 2008). In addition, more and more electricity generation takes place in a decentralized manner. Combined heat and power (CHP) plants and self-supply of industry could reduce the need for large gas power plants. It is not clear what this trend means for the average electricity price. In general, large centralized power plants exhibit lower unit costs of electricity generation compared to distributed generation, owing to economies of scale and higher efficiencies. Nevertheless, we are not following the discussion on this kind of issues here. Rather, we take them as a starting point for our analysis and hypothesize that there is underinvestment of large gas power plants. We ask how this specific energy policy situation in Germany affects the average electricity price and how this consequently impacts on the competitiveness of the energy intensive industries in Germany. This is a central question, because manufacturing has become an important determinant for Germany’s recent macroeconomic resilience. Consequently, there is a discussion whether energy intensive industries should be exempted from certain policies in order not to harm their competitiveness. Besides, energy intensive industries also manufacture substantial components for renewable energy technologies (e.g. steel for wind turbines). Evidence on the significance of energy costs for the placement of manufacturing facilities is also given by recent shale gas and oil discoveries in the U.S. and subsequent energy price falls, which have attracted U.S. companies to move their international manufacturing operations back to the U.S. (The Economist, 2013). In a globalized economy, changes of national competitiveness will affect other countries’ competitiveness. We therefore ask who benefits most from the occurring competitiveness shifts and which of the energy intensive sectors is especially affected. For our global economic analysis, a worldwide macroeconomic model is needed, which represents a closed circular flow of income. Therefore we use the NEWAGE model from IER Stuttgart, which is a global multi-sector computable general equilibrium (CGE) model with a detailed representation of the energy sector and disaggregated electricity generation technologies. Due to the total analytical framework of the general equilibrium approach, the interaction of actors on markets of the economy is described in a closed circular flow of income. This allows capturing both direct effects in individual sectors (e.g. electricity) as well as indirect effects (feedback effects) across the economy that are caused by price-induced supply and demand shifts in response to any political intervention. The basic assumption of the general equilibrium approach is perfect competition on all factor and goods markets. Firms buy production factors and sell goods following cost minimization. Consumers buy these goods using their income from selling the production factors following utility maximization. The government imposes taxes and grants subsidies following guidance and fiscal objectives. The equilibrium system is solved for the variables prices, production levels and income. The NEWAGE model is based on the GTAP database and maps the global economy into 10 countries/regions and 16 sectors. The production of goods in the 16 sectors is modeled with CES (constant elasticity of substitution) production functions, where output is produced as a combination of the input factors capital, labor, energy and materials. The degree to which inputs can be substituted for each other is determined by the respective elasticities of substitution, which are based on technical assumptions or taken from the literature. CO2 allowances are an additional input if fossil fuels are used. The assumption of perfect competition may be waived in special markets, as is done for the labor market in NEWAGE to reflect imbalances existing on real labor markets. Therefore, the model considers unemployment, wage rigidities and different grades of labor qualifications (skilled, unskilled). The dynamic approach is recursive-dynamic applying 5-year milestones from 2010 to 2030. Competitiveness can be measured by different indicators, such as trade balance or trade volume per sector and country, or more complex concepts, such as the Relative World Trade Share (RWS) or the Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) (see Klepper & Peterson, 2008). The RWTS relates the share of national exports and world exports of a sector to the share of total national and total world exports. The RCA relates the national terms-of-trade of one sector to the total national terms-of-trade. The changes in these indicators reflect the production shifts as a result of changes in the input cost structure of the energy intensive industries, i.e. their competitiveness. For analyzing the impacts of possible underinvestment of large gas power plants on the electricity price in Germany and the competitiveness of national energy intensive industries we conduct scenario analysis in a two-stage approach: 1) Effects of underinvestment in large gas power plants on the electricity price (average price) 2) Effects of electricity price changes on sectoral and national competitiveness of energy intensive industries The first step is to fix the production from new gas power plants to the value of 2010, meaning that there are no further investments than already in place. Then we assess the implications of this constraint for the German electricity price and, as a second step, assess the implications of the electricity price change for the competitiveness of the energy intensive industries in Germany and worldwide. We evaluate these experiments against a reference scenario from 2010 to 2030 where moderate gas power investments still occur, even though there is renewable energy promotion via feed-in tariffs. We calculate impacts for all of the above mentioned competitiveness indicators to check for robustness. The effects are measured in a relative manner, which enables us to control for the arbitrary assumptions of the reference scenario and isolate competitiveness effects. This means that we conduct our analysis producing relative, not absolute results regarding physical or monetary units. Within the general equilibrium approach we are able to capture global adjustment processes responding to the impulse of single sectoral or national policy interventions. Our results indicate which countries in the world profit from these energy constraints in Germany, and which of the energy intensive sectors is particularly affected."
In Search of the Legal Basis for Environmental and Energy Regulation at the EU Level: The Case of Unconventional Gas Extraction,2014,"The relation of the energy and environmental competences in the European Union (EU) in terms of renewable energy and its promotion and impact on climate change has been subject to intense academic discussion as well as to judicial review. The general tendency is for measures regarding renewable energy to be passed on both competences, depending on the specific content and objective. Other forms of energy, however, have not been included in this debate. The outcome outside the area of renewable energy is expected to be quite different. Shale gas extraction, for example, is associated with negative, or at least problematic, environmental impacts, alongside the benefits it offers to the security of the EU's energy supply. Consequently, the question of competence is not straightforward. This article analyzes the interplay and conflicts between the energy and environmental titles of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union in the context of shale gas activities. The article further explores the importance of ‘significance’ in this setting, and how this concept is crucial in determining the appropriate decision-making procedure to pass a legal measure on shale gas in practice."
"Lagging and Flagging: Air Pollution, Shale Gas Exploration and the Interaction of Policy, Science, Ethics and Environmental Justice in England.",2020,"The science on the effects of global climate change and air pollution on morbidity and mortality is clear and debate now centres around the scale and precise contributions of particular pollutants. Sufficient data existed in recent decades to support the adoption of precautionary public health policies relating to fossil fuels including shale exploration. Yet air quality and related public health impacts linked to ethical and environmental justice elements are often marginalized or missing in planning and associated decision making. Industry and government policies and practices, laws and planning regulations lagged well behind the science in the United Kingdom. This paper explores the reasons for this and what shaped some of those policies. Why did shale gas policies in England fail to fully address public health priorities and neglect ethical and environmental justice concerns. To answer this question, an interdisciplinary analysis is needed informed by a theoretical framework of how air pollution and climate change are largely discounted in the complex realpolitik of policy and regulation for shale gas development in England. Sources, including official government, regulatory and planning documents, as well as industry and scientific publications are examined and benchmarked against the science and ethical and environmental justice criteria. Further, our typology illustrates how the process works drawing on an analysis of official policy documents and statements on planning and regulatory oversight of shale exploration in England, and material from industry and their consultants relating to proposed shale oil and gas development. Currently the oil, gas and chemical industries in England continue to dominate and influence energy and feedstock-related policy making to the detriment of ethical and environmental justice decision making with significant consequences for public health."
Mineral Energy Sources and Political Activities: Introduction to Mutual Dependencies and Their Selected Exemplification,2014,"The mineral energy sources, possessed by a certain state or remaining an object of interest for it, may form a basis for political activities, both oriented on usage either of the purely political (non-militarized) or militarized methods. The usage of these sources in the political context may have a natural impact on the essence of sustainable development, especially then if to juxtapose it with previous experiences of the mankind. The natural gas based energy policy seems to be the key factor for the above political activities of states with imperial ambitions, as the contemporary Russia. Referring to the shale gas, the syndrome as such concerns the monopolistic position of the USA in terms of the applied exploitation technologies. The size of coal mining and steel production at the turn of the 19th and 20th century, or oil fields’ possession and their usage before and during WW II used to play such a role in the past. In both of these cases there were necessary prerequisites for planning the military campaigns in potential wars (envisaged as successful indeed). Fortunately such an extreme way of conducting political activities is not confirmed today. Following the same trace the policy of the possessed energy sources’ usage, or taking over those being in possession of others, might ultimately lead towards maintaining an economic and perhaps political supremacy of ones over others. On the one hand it demonstrates the policy of pressure led by stronger, imperially oriented states against weaker and dependent ones. On the other one, it shows the results of the mutual antagonizing policy of the latter stimulated by the stronger state- and non-state-like entities, having their own interests. Due to some experiences, taken from the most recent past, one can speculate, if the possessed or desired energy sources may be utilized as a tool for unequivocally political decisions, also in the military sphere. It is hard to be optimistic bearing in mind the rule that history tends to repeat itself. Such scepticism is even deeper if we realize that the control over the water reserves remains a source of the future large-scale international conflicts."
Monitoring Marcellus: A Case Study of a Collaborative Volunteer Monitoring Project to Document the Impact of Unconventional Shale Gas Extraction on Small Streams,2016,"The rapid growth of the natural gas extraction industry in Pennsylvania and neighboring states has stirred concerned citizens to seek ways to collect data on water quality impacts from the extraction activi- ties. As a response to requests from community members, the Alliance for Aquatic Resource Monitoring (ALLARM) developed a volunteer-friendly protocol in 2010 for early detection and reporting of surface water contamination by shale gas extraction activities in small streams. To date, ALLARM has trained more than 2,000 volunteers in Pennsylvania, New York, and West Virginia to monitor water quality (conductivity, barium, strontium, and total dissolved solids) and physical parameters (stream stage and visual observations) prior to, during, and after shale gas wells have been developed. This paper documents the operational models of Public Participation in Scientific Research (PPSR) used by ALLARM, describes the volunteer monitoring protocol developed, and examines three years of water quality results from hundreds of monitoring sites in Pennsylvania and New York. The majority of watersheds monitored are small, forested, headwater streams. Results indicate that mean conductivity in streams is strongly and positively related to the percentage of development and the percentage of limestone in the watersheds. Mean conductivity is not significantly related to number or density of drilled wells, although the dataset did not lend itself to finding a signal from shale gas activities because only 20% of the watersheds had wells drilled at the time of sampling. This fact enables the use of these data as baseline data for future documentation of shale gas impacts on water quality. Volunteers have reported multiple cases of visual pollution related to shale gas activities, but have not identified water contamination events based on stream water chemistry. The results of the volunteer dataset are compared with results from the scientific literature, affirming the credibility and usefulness of the data. Some lessons learned from this project include: The importance of strong and timely support to volunteers to ensure accurate reporting in real-time; the unique role that citi- zen scientists can play in a rural landscape where well sites are remote and government oversight is not prac- tical; and the importance of customizing a PPSR operational model to fit the goals and scale of the project. Recommendations for continued collection and analysis of data include: 1) develop and implement an intentional study design to monitor those watersheds that now have baseline data once drilling begins, 2) target watersheds whose characteristics are under-represented in this dataset, 3) consider the analysis of additional parameters and the monitoring of high risk systems, 4) develop a central, user-friendly data- base for volunteers to submit their own data and receive preliminary analyses, and 5) partner with other volunteer data collectors to collaborate with data analysis and interpretation."
Multi-criteria decision making and fairness evaluation of water ecological carrying capacity for inter-regional green development.,2021,"Determining water ecological carrying capacity (WECC) is of great significance to ensure inter-regional green development. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation framework for WECC assessment in the Yangtze River Economic Zone (YREZ), China. Effects of water resources, socio-economic, and ecological elements on WECC can be evaluated based on multi-criteria decision analysis. Gini and unbalance coefficients are used for measuring the regional fairness between WECC and socio-economic development. Surface water production pressure (SWPP) and groundwater pollution risk (GPR) are further regarded as indicators for expressing water resources constraint on shale gas extraction in the YREZ. Results disclose that the average WECC level decreases from 0.439 in 2000 to 0.4007 in 2016, which is the opposite of the changing trend in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region. A high WECC level appears in Zhejiang (0.5126) with a good state, but that of Guizhou (0.3983), Anhui (0.3968), Hunan (0.3914), and Chongqing (0.3651) are at the alert state. The obstacle factors of WECC in the eastern YREZ mostly originate from socio-economic and water resource subsystems, while that in the middle and western YREZ mainly arise from water resources and ecological subsystems. Fairness analysis shows a well-matching characteristic between the overall WECC and socio-economic performances due to a majority of their Gini coefficients lower than 0.4, while a poor matching characteristic exists in terms of provincial differences owing to their varied unbalance coefficients, especially in Guizhou, Jiangsu, and Shanghai. Moreover, Chongqing with most of shale gas reserves is characterized by slight SWPP (1.0202) and GPR (0.0188), but the prospect of shale gas development in Sichuan is not optimistic due to its high SWPP (1.0846) and GPR (0.0647). Recycling of flowback and product waters can significantly lighten regional water resources pressure. This presented framework can be applied into many other Chinese cities (e.g., Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region) with slight modifications according to their actual situations for supporting water resource managers and government with decision making."

"NEPA, Climate Change, and Public Lands Decision-Making",2011,"One of the most difficult challenges facing public land managers today is how to address climate change in a meaningful way when making decisions affecting public lands. This problem is largely the product of the high levels of uncertainty surrounding climate change and the potential consequences of climate change for the large and complex landscapes and ecosystems that public land agencies manage.In February 2010, the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) issued draft guidance to federal agencies describing how these agencies should address climate change in their decision documents. Recognizing the difficulty of the task, however, the CEQ’s draft guidance expressly disclaimed any intention of affording assistance to public land management agencies making complex land use decisions. NEPA, Climate Change and Public Lands Decision-Making seeks to fill that gap. It begins by describing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the unique difficulties in applying NEPA to climate change and public land management. It then considers three case studies that illustrate the complex challenges that face public land managers, including: (1) the Forest Service’s treatment of the Mountain Pine Beetle in Colorado and Southern Wyoming; (2) the Regional Water Supply Pipeline proposal to bring 250,000 acre feet of water from the Colorado River Basin to the Front Range of Colorado and Southern Wyoming; and (3) fossil fuel leasing on public lands in general, with specific discussions of shale gas fracking, coal mine methane, and oil shale extraction. These case studies form the basis for a series of recommendations for the CEQ and land use planning agencies. Most importantly, the article recommends that land use planning agencies quantify the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that result from their proposed actions and attach a price to those emissions that reflects the marginal social cost of climate change that might result from those emissions. Although the social cost of GHG emissions may be uncertain, assigning a price to those emissions that reflects their social cost will promote more accurate cost assessments, and ensures that such costs become a meaningful part of the decision-making process. The article also recommends that the CEQ propose rules to ensure that agencies are held accountable when they commit to adaptive management in their decision documents. Finally, the article offers several general recommendations for coping effectively with the uncertainty and scale of climate change."
New legitimacy to concerns about fracking and health,2014,"While scientists and area residents have been sounding the alarm about the health impacts of shale gas drilling for years, recent studies, a legal decision and public health advocates are bringing greater legitimacy to concerns. Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, involves drilling vertically, then"
Origins and Consequences of State-Level Variation in Shale Regulation: The Cases of Pennsylvania and New York,2015,"The combination of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling unlocked the economic potential of shale gas in the United States. However, the regulatory response to shale gas has varied substantially. This chapter considers the political economy of Marcellus Shale, focusing on differences in regulatory responses in Pennsylvania and New York. It suggests that the regulatory response in Pennsylvania is “efficient” and that different responses can be explained by features of politics, rather than geography, relative prices, or institutions. The chapter concludes by considering the benefits and costs of federal regulation of fracking. Although states have varied substantially in their response to fracking, decentralized governance of shale gas has many benefits and few discernible costs."
Participatory Air Monitoring in the Midst of Uncertainty: Residents’ Experiences with the Speck Sensor,2017,"How do participants engage in at-home air monitoring in the midst of uncertain exposures to airborne emissions associated with unconventional natural gas development (UNGD) activities? We investigate residents’ experiences with the “Speck” particulate matter sensor with an emerging environmental health resource center called the Southwest Pennsylvania Environmental Health Project (EHP).  In response to the gaps in knowledge about the health impacts of UNGD and the growth citizen science tools, participatory environmental monitoring (PEM) projects have taken off in shale gas communities. Using interview and survey data from residents, advocates, and activists we show that residents use the Speck as: 1) “environmental health thermometers” to make real time decisions based on readings; 2) real-time tools of exposure-validation to immediately validate or invalidate suspicions of exposure; 3) “epistemic objects” or tools manipulated in exploratory ways to understand their efficacy in monitoring UNGD; and 4) passively by those who chose to rarely interact with the monitors and rather waited for overall analysis of results.  While PEM’s have been critiqued for potentially passing the burden of monitoring onto communities, our research shows PEM, when connected with research and public health organizations like EHP, can both empower individuals by increasing their perceived and actual agency and build collective knowledge by producing novel scientific findings. The modes of participation identified here each imply individual and community-level outcomes. When connected with an organization like EHP, Speck monitoring enabled participating individual the latitude to develop their own research and make immediate use of the data, while also creating data useful for aggregated scientific analyses that provoke new questions about the health risks associated with UNGD."
Peak oil and energy policy—a critique,2011,"Energy policy has frequently been based upon assumptions about future oil prices. At the end of the 1970s it was assumed oil prices would continue to rise. Now a similar assumption pervades policy design. This article critiques the peak oil hypotheses which lie behind these forecasts and policy beliefs, and considers that, from a climate change perspective, the challenge is too much not too little fossil fuel reserves. The coming of shale gas, its fungibility with oil via the electrification of transport, along with technological advances in increasing the depletion rates of existing wells and new reserves, together undermine that assumption that rising oil prices will rapidly make renewable and other low-carbon technologies cost competitive without subsidies. The paper suggests indexing carbon prices to the oil price, infrastructure investment, strategic storage, and a focus on market failures provides a superior approach to energy policy rather than relying on forecasts of oil prices and picking winners."
Policy decisions on shale gas development ('fracking'): the insufficiency of science and necessity of moral thought,2015,"A constant refrain in both public discourse and academic research on shale gas development has been the necessity for 'sound science' to govern policy decisions. Rare, however, is the recommendation that effective policy on this topic also include 'sound moral thought'. I argue that: (1) philosophy (particularly moral thought and ethical reasoning) and science must work in tandem for making good policy decisions related to shale gas development, and (2) this realisation is essential for policy-makers, journalists, researchers, educators and the public. By examining the range of normative claims offered within academic and public discourse, the variation in claims across contexts and the degree to which the normative arguments are well-supported, I illustrate the important role increased attention to moral thought could play in forwarding policy construction on shale gas development. Finally, I offer recommendations for how policy-makers, journalists, researchers and educators can more actively acknowledge the importance of both science and moral thought in policy-making related to shale gas development."
"Policy learning, motivated scepticism, and the politics of shale gas development in British Columbia and Quebec",2017,"AbstractWhat is policy learning and how do we know when we observe it? This article develops an original way of operationalizing policy learning at the individual and subsystem level. First, it juxtaposes four types of opinion change at the individual level – opinion shifting; opinion softening; position-taking and opinion hardening. This last change, we argue is indicative of motivated scepticism, a non-learning process that we borrow from public opinion studies. Second, we identify factors associated with opinion change and argue that some of them indicate policy learning, while others point to motivated scepticism. Lastly, we examine learning and motivated scepticism against patterns of opinion convergence (the expected outcome of learning) and polarization (the expected outcome of motivated scepticism) at the subsystem level. We illustrate the use of this approach to study policy learning with the case of shale gas development in two Canadian provinces, British Columbia and Quebec. While, we find clea..."
Policy recommendations to promote shale gas development in China based on a technical and economic evaluation,2015,"Because of its resource potential and clean burning advantages, the development of shale gas can significantly increase the supply of cleaner energy while offering the associated benefits. To foster shale gas development, many policy incentives have been introduced in China. However, the current incentives have not been sufficiently aggressive, and the shale gas industry has been slow to develop. Existing policies thus need to be further improved. To provide effective support for decision makers in China, a technical and economic evaluation is performed in this study to explore the profitability of shale gas production in pilot zones. The results show that shale gas production is subeconomic under the current technical and economic conditions. Based on this evaluation, a policy analysis is conducted to investigate the profitability improvement offered by the major policies available in China to elucidate a path toward improving incentive policies. The results indicate that policy instruments related to gas prices, financial subsidies, corporate income taxes or combinations thereof could be used as priority options to improve policy incentives. Based on these results, recommendations are presented to improve the current incentive polices aimed at accelerating shale gas development."
"Promising synergies to address water, sequestration, legal, and public acceptance issues associated with large-scale implementation of CO2 sequestration",2012,"Stabilization of CO2 atmospheric concentrations requires practical strategies to address the challenges posed by the continued use of coal for baseload-electricity production. Over the next two decades, CO2 capture and sequestration (CCS) demonstration projects would need to increase several orders of magnitude across the globe in both size and scale. This task has several potential barriers which will have to be accounted for. These barriers include those that have been known for a number of years including safety of subsurface sequestration, pore-space competition with emerging activities like shale gas production, legal and regulatory frameworks, and public acceptance and technical communication. In addition water management is a new challenge that should be actively and carefully considered across all CCS operations. A review of the new insights gained on these previously and newly identified challenges, since the IPCC special report on CCS, is presented in this paper. While somewhat daunting in scope, some of these challenges can be addressed more easily by recognizing the potential advantageous synergies that can be exploited when these challenges are dealt with in combination. For example, active management of water resources, including brine in deep subsurface formations, can provide the additional cooling-water required by the CO2 capture retrofitting process while simultaneously reducing sequestration leakage risk and furthering efforts toward public acceptance. This comprehensive assessment indicates that water, sequestration, legal, and public acceptance challenges ought to be researched individually, but must also be examined collectively to exploit the promising synergies identified herein. Exploitation of these synergies provides the best possibilities for successful large-scale implementation of CCS."
Regulating Water Security in Unconventional Oil and Gas: An Introduction,2020,"The last 20 years have seen dramatic growth in the production of oil and gas from shale, as production techniques developed in the latter half of the twentieth century have advanced under largely favorable economic conditions. Hydraulic fracturing is a well stimulation technique in which sand and other proppants suspended in fluids are forced at high pressure through cracks in shale rock to free hydrocarbons to flow to the surface. This requires significant volumes of water and presents challenges for protecting nearby humans and the environment from water, air, and noise pollution, as well as other effects of the activity. Legal, policy, and regulatory issues related to the use of water for hydraulic fracturing are present at every stage of such “unconventional” operations. Operators must understand the legal, political and hydrological context of their surroundings, gain community cooperation or confront social resistance, procure water for use in the fracturing and extraction processes, collect flowback and produced water, and dispose of these waters safely. A recent study found significant increases in water use for hydraulic fracturing and wastewater production in major shale gas and oil production regions, with attendant increases in water-use intensity over time (i.e., water use normalized to the energy production) (Kondash et al. 2018). The water volumes required for hydraulic fracturing are only likely to grow over time, as will the challenges of meeting that demand, and of disposing of wastewater associated with that production. This book considers how regulators and other decision makers have addressed many of these issues, considering varying legal frameworks, political systems, social acceptance, and geologies around the world (Fig. 1.1)."
Risks and risk governance in unconventional shale gas development.,2014,"A broad assessment is provided of the current state of knowledge regarding the risks associated with shale gas development and their governance. For the principal domains of risk, we identify observed and potential hazards and promising mitigation options to address them, characterizing current knowledge and research needs. Important unresolved research questions are identified for each area of risk, however, certain domains exhibit especially acute deficits of knowledge and attention, including integrated studies of public health, ecosystems, air quality, socioeconomic impacts on communities, and climate change. For these, current research and analysis are insufficient to either confirm or preclude important impacts. The rapidly evolving landscape of shale gas governance in the U.S. is also assessed, noting challenges and opportunities associated with the current decentralized (state-focused) system of regulation. We briefly review emerging approaches to shale gas governance in other nations, and conside..."
Shale gas development: a smart regulation framework.,2014,"Advances in directional drilling and hydraulic fracturing have sparked a natural gas boom from shale formations in the United States. Regulators face a rapidly changing industry comprised of hundreds of players, operating tens of thousands of wells across 30 states. They are often challenged to respond by budget cuts, a brain drain to industry, regulations designed for conventional gas developments, insufficient information, and deeply polarized debates about hydraulic fracturing and its regulation. As a result, shale gas governance remains a halting patchwork of rules, undermining opportunities to effectively characterize and mitigate development risk.The situation is dynamic, with research and incremental regulatory advances underway. Into this mix, we offer the CO/RE framework—characterization of risk, optimization of mitigation strategies, regulation, and enforcement—to design tailored governance strategies. We then apply CO/RE to three types of shale gas risks, to illustrate its potential utility to ..."
"Shale Gas Development: If the Goal is Fact-Based Regulation, What are the Facts?",2011,"The term “fracing” has become the lightning rod for environmental concerns related to the development of the vast shale gas resources in the United States and the world. This initiative is focused on, but not limited to, compiling specific concerns that have been raised about hydraulic fracturing and determining which ones have been investigated and verified and which ones have not. For those that have been authenticated, we are seeking information on the part of the development and production process that actually caused the problem. Based on separating facts from perceptions and misrepresentations, we will formulate ecommendations regarding ways to ensure that policies, regulations, and public opinions reflect actual conditions and impacts. Seismicity and air quality impacts are also being addressed. The goal is to promote a regulatory framework that is grounded in scientific understanding and to achieve effective communication of factbased assessments of environmental impacts. ￻"
"Shale gas extraction, precaution and prevention: A conversation on regulatory responses",2016,"Abstract Shale gas in the EU and its Member States faces increasing attention from a regulatory perspective. Questions about the role of law regarding the development of shale gas extraction in Europe are being asked. The role of law within science, as Laurie et al. suggest, involves an important decision: “whether the law is an enabler or a prohibitor of technologies” (Laurie, G., Harmon, S.H., Arzuaga, F., ‘Foresighting Futures: Law, New Technologies, and the Challenges of Regulating for Uncertainty’ 4 Law, Innovation and Technology 1 (2012), 1–33, at 10) [1] . At best, the law should promote the development of a technology without unduly compromising the protection of society and the environment from consequences of uncertainties and potential threats of an associated technology (Laurie, G., Harmon, S.H., Arzuaga, F., ‘Foresighting Futures: Law, New Technologies, and the Challenges of Regulating for Uncertainty’ 4 Law, Innovation and Technology 1 (2012), 1–33, at 10) [2] . The principles of precaution and prevention are the two main tools of European law, which shall help to strike a balance between enabling and prohibiting the development of an emerging energy technology like shale gas extraction. This article departs from the perspective that law at EU level is imposing control on the management of “known” risks via the preventive principle. Regarding “uncertainties” or “unknowns”, decision makers are legally obliged to be guided by the precautionary principle. This paper discusses the two environmental law principles – precaution or prevention – and contemplates which of them would be most apt for guiding the regulation of shale gas extraction in Europe. It concludes that regulation on shale gas extraction could be based on either of these principles for different reasons."
Shale gas governance in the United Kingdom and the United States: Opportunities for public participation and the implications for social justice,2017,"Abstract Questions abound about the appropriate governance systems to manage the risks of unconventional oil and gas development, and the ability for citizens to engage and participate in those systems. In this paper, we map the development of shale gas governance in the US and UK; we highlight the contrasting systems of land ownership and mineral rights, compare the opportunities that these systems of governance present the general public to participate and become involved in shale gas decisions and consider the implications on issues of social justice. We conclude that in both countries, that despite government and industry engagement rhetoric and associated processes, the publics’ influence on shale gas decisions is perceived to be minimal or not at all. We argue that the implications of the observed institutional governance systems, with few opportunities for citizen influence, are developments which inherently lack social justice, procedural fairness, and ultimately, a social license to operate."
Shale gas operator violations in the Marcellus and what they tell us about water resource risks,2015,"Abstract Development of shale gas entails environmental risk, particularly with respect to water resources, and stakeholders are keen to assess such risks before making development decisions. We focus on Pennsylvania, USA and the Marcellus Shale, the most productive shale play in the country. We examine compliance data recorded by the state regulatory agency in order to assess environmental risks and their trends and drivers over time. Overall, we track 3267 shale gas violations, noting that environmental violation rates increase from 2007 to 2009, remain high through 2010, and then drop in 2011 and thereafter. Violations related to spills and erosion were most commonly issued. A single change in policy resulted in a 45% decrease in environmental violation rates. Furthermore, for every 1% increase in wells drilled per inspections conducted, there was a 0.56% decrease in environmental violation rates. Similar effects were not found for administrative violations. Operator identity, price of gas, and other major policies were not significantly correlated with violation rates. In comparing conventional and shale gas extraction compliance we found that shale gas development entails more risk related to spills and solid waste management, while conventional development entails more risk associated with cementing and casing issues, and site restoration."
Shale Gas U-Turns in Bulgaria and Romania: The Turbulent Politics of Energy and Protest,2014,"After France, Bulgaria became the second EU country to enact an open-ended ban on hydraulic fracturing in early 2012. This government action was a radical departure from an initially friendly, even enthusiastic stance on unconventional gas development. It resulted in months of unprecedented, broad political protest from environmental groups and local communities. The conflict was interpreted as one involving old questions about Bulgaria’s orientation toward Russia or the West. In neighbouring Romania, Bulgaria’s U-turn on shale gas energized a protest movement which had been relatively weak. In a turbulent election-year context, political leaders scrambled to deal with highly symbolic issues. A new government introduced a moratorium but ended it less than a year later. Another U-turn in public policy happened. Romania parted from Bulgaria’s example and set out to move forward on shale gas, aiding foreign investors. Massive protests against the policy and the investors surged, encircling the drilling operations. In both countries, public mistrust in institutions, environmental regulations and due process of law is a significant factor of political risk for energy companies.

Shale Governance in the European Union: Principles and Practice,2014,"The extraction of shale gas — mainly through the process of hydraulic fracturing or “fracking” — has become a central if contentious area of energy policy in the European Union (EU). Like their US counterparts, European policymakers are attracted by the potential huge economic and energy benefits of shale extraction, yet must also address dangers and risks associated with extracting natural gas from shale fields. How might policymakers govern this new policy area? Europe’s approach to shale gas governance is still in its infancy, but several guiding principles can be identified through an examination of the EU’s treaties, rules, policy principles, and practices. The most important governing principles include the precautionary principle, transparency, consultation/stakeholder “buy-in,” and environmental sustainability. Adoption of such governance principles provides useful guidelines for policymakers, and reassurance for the public. Positive lessons from their application can be applied to the US. But a close examination of their application in the EU suggests two important themes. First is the importance of context: how, when and why principles are applied will shape their effectiveness and impact. Secondly, the examination reveals that each of these principles is double-edged with clear advantages and clear limits. None alone will provide the “golden ticket” to effective shale governance."
Shale play politics: the intergovernmental Odyssey of American shale governance.,2014,"Intergovernmental responsibility for policy development for shale gas is concentrated primarily at the state level, given multiple statutory and political constraints on potential federal engagement. This opens the question of how a large subset of American states might craft shale policies, amid competing scholarly views on the commitment of states to environmental protection when energy development opportunities arise in the absence of applicable federal authority. The article examines recent trends in state political economy that may shape policy development and capacity, considers the heterogeneous pattern of policy emerging thus far, and draws preliminary lessons from the very small set of states that have enacted far-reaching new state legislation. It also offers early discussion of cross-border issues that may trigger multistate, regional, or ultimately federal engagement as well as growing signs of volatility in policy development in some states."
Stakeholder engagement in large-scale energy infrastructure projects: Revealing perspectives using Q methodology,2016,"Abstract Public opposition is one of the main political, and less predictable, risks of large-scale energy infrastructure projects. External stakeholder management has become indispensable to the governance of risk in such projects. We integrate insights on public engagement from policy and planning studies with the field of project management to contribute to the governance of risk. We present Q methodology as a congruent method for stakeholder analysis that allows for anticipation of unforeseen stakeholder issues or concerns and to kick-off a participatory procedure with external stakeholders. We present an illustration of Q methodology results of a Dutch shale gas exploration project. If used in the stakeholder management process, this method can help reveal perspectives beneficial for both the governance of risks and the identification of opportunities to create socially valued, successful projects."
"Steering Social Outcomes in America’s Energy Heartland State and Private Meta-Governance in the Marcellus Shale, Pennsylvania",2017,"This article argues that analysis of meta-governance purely in terms of the actions of the state can obscure the significant, but less apparent, ways in which private actors may influence the choices and interactions of individuals within various modes of governance coordination. We investigate the networked governance of affordable housing impacts in the Marcellus Shale gas region of the United States to empirically illuminate the dynamics of state and private meta-governance. Drawing on a qualitative research approach, we identify public authorities as exercising what seems to be predominant responsibility for meta-governance, with state government having strong influence over the structure and resourcing of a networked governance response, and county government directly facilitating the collaborative engagement of actors at the local level. Although private oil and gas companies demonstrate little involvement in network governance, the presence of private meta-governance in the alternative form of the design of market governance is shown to have a number of countervailing implications for the form and function of network governance. We suggest that expansion of the concept of “framing” to account for strategies that structure how key governance actors understand a particular problem provides valuable insights for understanding private meta-governance in relation to network governance."
Strategic ignorance and politics of time: how expert knowledge framed shale gas policies,2020,"The article addresses the various uses of expert knowledge during the controversy over shale gas in France and in Quebec (Canada). Cross-fertilization between policy analysis and science and technology studies demonstrates that political uses of expertise better explained the policymaking process in focusing on two specific utilizations: strategic ignorance and politics of time. Using data from press analysis, interviews, reports and documentation analysis, the article shows that social movements can also use strategic ignorance to support their environmental claims and that mastering the pace of the controversy and the policy debates enabled actors to better support their policy claims. The French case illustrates those two arguments while the Quebec case provides a more tradition account of State/Industry's utilization of knowledge production to delay decision and divert opposition."
"Suburbanization and shale gas wells: Patterns, planning perspectives, and reverse setback policies",2017,"Abstract From 2002 to 2015, the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex (DFW) experienced high population growth rates and booming shale gas production via hydraulic fracturing of the Barnett Shale. In response, DFW municipalities adopted gas well drilling ordinances and enacted setback distance policies to regulate the proximity between new gas wells and homes. However, landscape and planning impacts arising from subsequent development of homes around hydrocarbon extraction sites are unknown. Here, we use quantitative and qualitative methods to 1) quantify spatial and land-use effects of gas well production sites, 2) identify municipal staff perspectives on overlapping gas well and suburban landscapes, and 3) evaluate municipal governance strategies for dealing with subsequent development of homes around production sites. Our results show that production sites occupy approximately 3000 ha in DFW and nearly 2% of surface areas in some high growth municipalities. Over time, developed land covers increasingly surrounded gas production sites. We identified three statistically significant social perspectives among municipal officials, two indicating concern with how gas wells impede future urban development. The majority of municipal governments place the onus on homebuyers to decide whether to live near gas wells, though a few municipalities require notification of their presence. The parallel pressures to develop surface and mineral interests by two powerful industries – property developers and oil and gas operators, respectively – create a complex regulatory and planning environment for municipalities where protections of resident health, safety, and welfare are left to the discretion of corporate entities and social licenses."
The capacity of states to govern shale gas development risks.,2014,"The development of natural gas and oil from unconventional formations in the United States has grown substantially in recent years and has created governance challenges. In light of this recent growth, and increasing attention to global shale gas resources, the successes and failures of governance efforts in this country serve as important lessons for other nations that have their own unconventional petroleum resources and are beginning to move forward with development, thus calling for a more in-depth examination of the laws governing shale gas development and their implementation. Governance includes both the substance of laws and the activities of entities that implement and influence laws, and in the case of oil and gas, states are primarily responsible for risk governance. Nongovernmental actors and industry also work with states to shape and implement regulations and standards. This Policy Analysis introduces the role of various actors in U.S. shale gas governance, explaining why the states are primarily responsible for risk governance, and explores the capacity of states to conduct governance, examining the content of their laws and the strength of their regulatory entities. The Analysis concludes that states are, to a degree, addressing the changing risks of development. Gaps remain in the substance of regulations, however, and many states appear to lack adequate support or policies for training industry in compliance matters, monitoring activity at sites, prioritizing certain types of regulatory violations that pose the highest risks, enforcing laws, and ensuring that the public is aware of inspections and enforcement and can therefore monitor state activity."
"The contested future of fracking for shale gas in the UK: risk, reputation and regulation",2015,"Large shale gas reserves have recently been identified under many parts of the UK and the development pressure for detailed exploration, and possibly the commercial exploitation of these reserves by hydraulic fracturing, popularly described as fracking, is growing rapidly. Although exploration for shale gas is still at an early stage in the UK, the possible future development of shale gas by fracking has generated a wide range of environmental concerns. Two linked factors, namely the presence of a robust regulatory regime and the need for the gas industry to control reputation risk, seem to be important in addressing these concerns and arguably in facilitating the future development of shale gas resources within the UK. With this in mind this paper describes the characteristics of shale gas and the process of fracking, outlines some details on current estimates of the distribution and volume of shale gas and of its commercial recovery within the UK, provides a short commentary on the environmental risks associated with exploration and development and rehearses some of the arguments on the role of the regulatory planning framework and on campaigns to win public opinion and to manage reputation."
"The discursive politics of ‘fracking’: Frames, storylines, and the anticipatory contestation of shale gas development in the United Kingdom",2019,"Abstract How contested sources of energy such as shale gas are perceived in frontier countries considering their development is incredibly important to national and international climate policies. The UK shale development case is of particular interest currently as the Government attempts to position the UK as a pioneer of European, safe, sustainable shale gas development. We conduct a mixed-methods analysis of the UK policy debate on shale gas development involving 30 stakeholder interviews and 1557 political documents. This empirical focus extends the existing literature by identifying the use of frames in and through the institutions and practices of formal UK politics. We identify nine key frames and their associated storylines, analyse their use over time, and compare these findings with other national case studies. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given most UK Governments within our timeframe have supported shale development, pro-shale development frames dominate in the policy debate; however, we also find a high level of anti-shale development frame use, suggesting a deep and ongoing framing contest in national formal political sites. We find in particular a more prominent focus on land-use issues and impacts on the landscape than other UK studies or other national contexts. Conceptually, the study puts forward an integrative approach to the related concepts of frames and storylines, as well as arguments concerning the impotence of storylines in anticipatory political debate and the polyvalence of framing strategies. Questions about governance are raised by the general lack of consensus over the framing of shale development within formal political sites, let alone amongst the broader public; and by the lack of a coherent response from the Government to criticisms of its approach. Finally, we reflect on the apparent lack of evidence for Hajer’s ‘communicative miracle’ in our case, and speculate as to whether the lack of broad-based resonance of the ‘bridge’ storyline signals trouble for the positive-sum thinking of ecological modernisation."
The discursive politics of unconventional gas in Scotland: Drifting towards precaution?,2017,"Abstract With a long history of oil and gas production and potentially significant reserves of unconventional gas, Scotland represents a notable case amid the growing international controversy over unconventional gas development (UGD). This article applies argumentative discourse analysis to the Scottish debate over UGD and identifies several important storylines which have mobilised different discourse coalitions and shaped public opinion as well as policy-making. For now, anti-UGD storylines appear more encompassing and have achieved greater resonance. Of particular interest, however, is the role of the Scottish government as a third discourse coalition. Through a moratorium on all forms of UGD and a cautious ‘evidence-based approach', the government has established a form of discursive dominance and has successfully minimised electoral risks. But its anti-Westminster storyline – created in the run-up to the Scottish independence referendum in 2014 – has undermined the government's pragmatic strategy by invoking Scottish resistance to the UK’s pursuit of shale gas. While the evidence-based approach persists as the preeminent storyline, its interpretation has ‘drifted’ from (1) a modestly reformed planning policy to (2) an exercise in scientific fact-finding combined with a public consultation and, arguably, (3) to a precautionary approach that might lay the foundation for an extended moratorium."
The Fracking Revolution: Shale Gas as a Case Study in Innovation Policy,2015,"The early twenty-first century has witnessed a boom in oil and natural gas production that promises to turn the United States into a new form of petrostate. This boom raises various questions that scholars have begun to explore, including questions of risk governance, federalism, and export policy. Relatively neglected, however, have been questions of why the technological revolution behind the boom occurred and what this revolution teaches about innovation theory and policy. The boom in U.S. shale gas production reflected long-gestating infrastructure developments, a convergence of technological advances, government-sponsored research and development, the presence or absence of intellectual property rights, rights in tangible assets such as land and minerals, and tax and regulatory relief. Consequently, the story behind the boom reaches far beyond the risk-taking and persistence of George Mitchell, whose independent production company achieved pioneering success with hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) in Texas’ Barnett Shale. Indeed, the broader story demonstrates how a blend of distinct policy levers, reasonably adjusted over time, can combine to foster a diverse innovation ecosystem that provides a robust platform for game-changing innovation. As exemplified by this story, the centrality of other policy levers can mean that patents play only a modest role even in spurring technological development by profit-driven private players. Finally, the Article demonstrates how. Such lessons can helpfully inform efforts either to extend the United States’ “fracking revolution” abroad or to develop other potentially revolutionary technologies such as those associated with renewable energy. Lessons drawn from this case study include “negative lessons” about the possibility and even likelihood of downsides of a technological boom or the policies used to promote it — for example, environmental damage that more careful regulation of a developing technology such as fracking might have avoided. Anticipatory and continuing attention to such potential downsides can help prevent innovation-promoting policies from becoming “sticky” in a way that undercuts innovation’s promise and popular appeal."
The governance of shale gas production in South Africa,2016,"The proper governance of shale gas mining in the Karoo region of South Africa is important. With an estimated 390 trillion cubic feet of recoverable shale gas, large economic gains are possible. This may dramatically change the South African energy sector; in the United States, similar explorations have led to what pundits term the ‘shale gas revolution’. The development and production of shale gas hold economic advantages, but also potential environmental costs, thus the regulation of fracking activities is an important consideration as the development of shale gas in the Karoo progresses. This study reviews the regulations imposed in other countries as well as the current regulatory framework of South Africa. This article analyses these regulations in terms of the content of fracking fluid, seismic activity and the pricing regime. Effective regulation will be key to maximise a positive impact, should shale gas development continue."
"The lay of the land: The public, participation and policy in China’s fracking frenzy",2018,"Abstract This perspective paper examines the current policy landscape for hydraulic fracturing in China, with a focus on the role of public attitudes toward shale gas in China. We highlight the need for further research on public perceptions and responses in a non-democratic society, both for the potential protection of residents who might be affected by the technology as well as the valuable research data that can be contrasted with public perspectives and engagement in other countries. Although the empirical findings presented here are limited due to this being very preliminary research, our goal is to shed light on what existing data shows about current understanding and perceptions. We discuss preliminary data collected during a research trip to Beijing in late December 2017, and contrast it with the few empirical studies on China that exist to date (Sher and Wu, 2018; Yu et al., 2018). Our research demonstrates the need for further investigation of understanding and perceptions of shale gas in China, particularly as other countries (such as the United Kingdom and Poland) are beginning to look at expanding their own shale gas resources. A reflection on this will also lead to a discussion of the extent to which data from China does or does not relate to that from other nations."
The legal and commercial determinants of unconventional gas production in East Asia,2014,"The US “shale gas revolution” has triggered a worldwide search for unconventional gas in different forms on other continents. Asia’s growing demand for energy and need to switch from coal to natural gas has made governments in this region determined to exploit these newly accessible resources, inspired by the US experience. However, in addition to geological differences, the above-ground conditions in Asian countries are quite different from those in the USA. The papers in this Special Issue analyse the investment frameworks and the consequent outlook for unconventional gas production in China, Indonesia and Vietnam. Our paper sets the context for these accounts by identifying some relevant insights from the experience of the USA and summarises some of the key conclusions from the later papers. A number of common themes emerge from the case studies, for example: the limited capacity of government, the role of the national oil companies and other interested economic actors, complex approval procedures, poor coordination between different government agencies and between different levels of government, access to land, and inadequate infrastructure, as well as the inappropriate nature of the prevailing laws, regulations and contracts designed for the extraction of conventional hydrocarbons. Despite these commonalities, the specific nature of each potential constraint and their relative importance varies between each country and even across an individual country. One challenge arising from the nature of unconventional gas extraction that is common to all countries is the need for effective engagement with society."
"The Long Hello: Energy Governance, Public Participation, and ‘Fracking’",2020,"We discuss the promotion of shale gas as a part of a UK energy mix of renewable, fossil fuel and nuclear technologies. This seems to go against international agreements signed by the UK Government and others to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. We frame our discussion in terms of ‘Energy Governance’ and our own conceptualisation of social sustainability. However, we are also clear that all forms of electricity generation have not been without public controversy in the UK. Unconventional, shale gas or fracking seems to have been the most prominent and has highlighted a systemic and persistent issue; that of a lack of transparency and access to planning and decision-making surrounding energy developments in the UK and the lack of agency afforded to affected communities. We argue that collaborating with local communities, whereby diverse local needs, experiences and expertise, and priorities are explored is more likely to lead to decisions that are socially sustainable."
The politics of Asian fracking: Public risk perceptions towards shale gas development in China,2019,"Abstract Growing attention has been paid to understanding public risk perceptions of shale gas development. This research has largely been conducted in the United States and Europe. Arguably, the environmental and social risks posed by drilling are potentially more severe in places like China, due to its geography and political system. However, little is known how those constantly exposed to risks (the “affected” public) evaluate these risks. In this study, in-depth interviews were conducted with local residents (n=25) in Weiyuan County, Sichuan Province, the region with the largest shale gas reserves in the country, to identify the perceived risks of the affected Chinese public and to explore underlying factors that impact risk perception. Our results suggest that affected Chinese residents were most concerned about groundwater contamination and air pollution above all other risks, and they tended to link risks to spatial proximity to shale gas wells. The multifaceted nature of perceived benefits played a novel and nuanced role in Chinese residents’ risk perception. Pride and disempowerment were found to attenuate the risk judgments of affected Chinese residents, which has not been observed in previous literature. Our findings provides policymakers with insight into how to improve risk communications to enhance understanding of affected publics, as well as to better design compensation schemes that may address inequities."
The role of ethics in shale gas policies.,2014,"The United States has experienced a boom in natural gas production due to recent technological innovations that have enabled natural gas to be produced from unconventional sources, such as shale. There has been much discussion about the costs and benefits of developing shale gas among scientists, policy makers, and the general public. The debate has typically revolved around potential gains in economics, employment, energy independence, and national security as well as potential harms to the environment, the climate, and public health. In the face of scientific uncertainty, national and international governments must make decisions on how to proceed. So far, the results have been varied, with some governments banning the process, others enacting moratoria until it is better understood, and others explicitly sanctioning shale gas development. These policies reflect legislature's preferences to avoid false negative errors or false positive ones. Here we argue that policy makers have a prima facie duty to minimize false negatives based on three considerations: (1) protection from serious harm generally takes precedence over the enhancement of welfare; (2) minimizing false negatives in this case is more respectful to people's autonomy; and (3) alternative solutions exist that may provide many of the same benefits while minimizing many of the harms."
There’s no real choice but to sign: neoliberalization and normalization of hydraulic fracturing on Pennsylvania farmland,2014,"Finewood and Stroup (J Contemp Water Res Educ 147(1), 72–79, 2012) observe that as hydraulic fracturing for natural gas spreads across the USA, neoliberal ideologies normalize fracking’s potential dangers, including impacts to water and more general environmental quality. Theoretical observations like these must be tested empirically. I do so here, analyzing data from extensive fieldwork in Pennsylvania’s Bradford, Susquehanna, and Washington counties. Drawing on comparative mixed method data from fieldwork in northeastern Pennsylvania’s ‘Endless Mountains’ region and the Pittsburgh area, I compare how small-scale farmers perceive and sometimes enact elements of market-based, neoliberal rationality when assessing hydrofracking’s community, environmental, and economic outcomes. This paper explores why this matters sociologically, given small-scale farmers’ roles as land-use decision-makers, stewards of related natural resource development, and marginalized producers with limited access to market shares and subsidies. In counties like Bradford and Washington, impacts of fracking small-scale farmers have been under-studied. To address that gap, I examine impacts on farmers operating around natural gas development and within neoliberal economic structures. Analyzing extensive interview and ethnographic data, the following research questions are addressed: (1) Among small-scale farmers impacted by hydraulic fracturing, what evidence exists that neoliberal logic helps farmers normalize fracking? and (2) How does normalization interact with decisions to sign natural gas leases? My findings indicate that many farmers utilize neoliberal logic when assessing impacts of hydraulic fracturing and shale gas development, particularly as rapid energy development relates to their land-use decisions. Neoliberal normalization of hydraulic fracturing emerges most saliently regarding environmental outcomes and economic development. I connect this to small-scale farmers’ economic vulnerability and the limited agency in dictating land use near their farms."

Unconventional shale gas development: challenges for environmental policy and EA practice,2016,"AbstractThe growth of unconventional shale gas development has been accompanied by controversy over its environmental and social impacts. This paper reviews recent literature to clarify what is known and not known about the physical, chemical and toxicological properties of the process chemicals and wastewaters generated in hydraulic fracturing, the mechanisms and pathways by which they enter surface water and groundwater aquifers and the risks posed to human and ecosystem health. Assessing the impacts of unconventional shale gas development is clearly constrained by a lack of baseline information, complex hydrogeological histories for natural migration of hydrocarbons, lack of tracers to monitor and verify the source, timing and mechanism of contaminant migration into water resources. This is compounded by lack of transparency and accountability in policy decisions. The paper argues that managing the social and environmental risks of unconventional shale gas development calls for a new generation of impa..."
Understanding Local Regulation of Fracking: A Spatial Econometric Approach,2015,"(ProQuest: ... denotes formulae omitted.)High-volume hydraulic fracturing, also known as fracking, of underground shale gas deposits to capture natural gas is a controversial practice but one that is thriving in many areas of the United States. Concerns regarding fracking include local air and water quality, impacts on traffic from trucks required to move waste water and other materials, and social impacts related to a ""boomtown"" mentality. In recent years, several states have scrambled to address a lack of coherent fracking and shale gas regulation. Wyoming, Texas, Colorado, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Maryland have all significantly revised and strengthened their fracking regulations. Other states are in the middle of significant revisions that could result in some of the most forceful and comprehensive fracking regulations in the United States. Despite this, one can argue that no state yet has a comprehensive set of regulations, and states and municipalities can learn much from each other and from better information and analyses.Thirty home-rule states (and nine states with limited home-rule status) allow local communities to pass laws that extend restrictions on fracking beyond limits established by the state legislature. As a result, municipalities, townships, and counties can establish more effective, locally focused strategies and create variation in policy responses to potential negative impacts of shale gas drilling in their jurisdictions. We combine a comprehensive data set on local bans and moratoria in the state of New York with local-level census data and spatial characteristics linked through a geographic information system (GIS) in a spatial econometric analysis of local fracking policies. These data allow us to explore the determinants of local regulations that allow (or ban) fracking activities in New York, our test-case state. Despite New York's decision in December 2014 to maintain its state-level moratorium indefinitely (Kaplan 2014), this research is important given the prevalence of home-rule legislation in many states where fracking is occurring.A variety of factors can account for variation in local-level and state-level policymaking. For instance, adoption of policies related to renewable resource portfolio standards has been shown to be associated with economic, resourcebased, geographic, competitive, and political characteristics (Huang et al. 2007, Chandler 2009, Carley and Miller 2012). We expect that extensive state and local variation similarly will play a part in accounting for variation in fracking regulations.Understanding the determinants of local decision-making allows scholars and policymakers to differentiate the economic, cultural, risk, geographic, and sociodemographic factors underlying acceptance and resistance (Wustenhagen, Wolsink, and Burer 2007). With that information, stakeholders, government agencies, and resource developers can craftbetter solutions via bargaining, negotiations, improved mitigation measures, and education efforts or refuse development when such solutions are not available. Improved understanding also can alert policymakers to potential coopting of the process and concerns regarding environmental justice and/or make it easier for developers to craftbetter implementation plans that incur less opposition and produce more effective and efficient outcomes. Knowledge about the determinants of local policymaking, in this case related to fracking, can be applied broadly to acceptance of other energy facility and infrastructure projects (e.g., wind turbines) and to other public policy questions.Our econometric approach and GIS data set allow us to account for spatial clustering to determine the extent to which local policy actions are correlated with actions of nearby communities. This analysis allows us to determine whether spatially correlated unobserved influences have an effect on community actions even after controlling for demographic characteristics and other features. …"
Utilizing Web-Based Public Participation Geographical Information Systems: Filling Gaps of the Marcellus Shale Natural Gas Industry,2010,"An influx of natural gas extraction in the Marcellus Shale region of the United States presents serious environmental, public health, and social and behavioral health challenges to citizens, policymakers, enforcement agencies and industry. These challenges necessitated improved and more transparent data-sharing capacities between data ‘owners’ and data ‘users.’ FracTracker (www.fractracker.org) is a socially-networked public participation GIS formulated with the capacity to support both a knowledge collective and a geographical data mashup. FracTracker is a GeoWeb data repository focusing on the natural gas industry. This tool facilitates crowdsourced data and allows registered users to visualize the information as part of an empowerment design process. A concurrent storied-blog serves as the portal to the PPGIS tool, and synthesizes and translates data to further engage geographical and issue-based populations. The main features of FracTracker are the ability to blog and share drilling stories, upload and download geo-located data as various file types, visualize data onto basemaps, and save the visualizations as snapshots. FracTracker can be used to compare data and identify spatial patterns related to the shale gas industry to better understand the span of social, economic, land use, political, environmental, and public health considerations."
Who governs? Changing the representation of the common good - the case of shale gas in Quebec,2012,"In several countries, the exploration and exploitation of shale gas has become a politically controversial issue. Our paper analyses the case of shale gas exploration in the province of Quebec. Explorations by private companies, undertaken in 2009 and 2010, have provoked strong reactions from organized groups and citizens. The mobilisation by civil society has led to important changes in the governance of shale gas in Quebec. At first, the exploitation and exploration of shale gas was understood as solely a question of economic development through private investment. With the growing mobilisation, however, the debate has turned into a much broader discussion of Quebec's economic and political development. This shift in public debate is the result of a combination of factors: the growing articulation of social protest at different scales (from local towns to national coalitions and international networks); popular education via mobilizations and media exposure; and consultation conducted through an independent, public participatory venue. In this paper, we address the nature of this change from the point of view of interest formation. We argue that the spatial dimension in terms of territory, place, and scale of the conflict articulates itself differently for the actors involved in each arena of conflict. While for social actors the spatial dimension of the shale gas conflict empowered their movement, the contrary was the case for economic interests."
Fuel to the fire : Risk governance and framing of shale gas in the Netherlands,2018,"Abstract Public resistance to shale gas in the Netherlands came as a surprise to governing actors. The Netherlands was a ‘gas land’ and shale gas extraction had been successfully framed as ‘business as usual’. However, in the eyes of the general public it turned into a ‘risky business’, and national government had to adjust their risk governance strategies. This study of the dynamics between national government’s risk governance strategies, framing, and societal responses, shows that this wicked problem could not be managed by authoritative risk governance strategies, nor by collaborative risk governance strategies. Rather, these strategies added fuel to the fire, and resistance increased. The results indicate that all sorts of risk governance strategies, but especially collaborative risk governance strategies, should better take into account the normative dimensions of a conflict, and reflect on who is the legitimate actor to govern the issue. This ‘controversy governance’ includes the possibility to discuss the desirability and necessity of mining activities, and a reflection on who is a legitimate decision maker on a wicked problem."
'Greenwashing gas: Might a 'transition fuel' label legitimize carbon-intensive natural gas development?'',2012,"Natural gas is widely considered to be the crucial ‘‘bridging fuel’’ in the transition to the low-carbon energy systems necessary to mitigate climate change. This paper develops a case study of the shale gas industry in British Columbia (BC), Canada to evaluate this assumption. We find that the transition fuel argument for gas development in BC is unsubstantiated by the best available evidence. Emissions factors for shale gas and LNG remain poorly characterized and contested in the academic literature, and context-specific factors have significant impacts on the lifecycle emissions of shale gas but have not been evaluated. Moreover, while the province has attempted to frame natural gas development within its ambitious climate change policy, this framing misrepresents substantive policy on gas production. The ‘‘transition fuel’’ and ‘‘climate solution’’ labels applied to development by the BC provincial government risk legitimizing carbon-intensive gas development. We argue that policy makers in BC and beyond should abandon the ‘‘transition fuel’’ characterization of natural gas. Instead, decision making about natural gas development should proceed through transparent engagement with the best available evidence to ensure that natural gas lives up to its best potential in supporting a transition to a low-carbon energy system."
Argentina entra con YPF en el club de las NOC,2012,"Repsol ha sido la ultima victima de la tendencia de los Estados a controlar sus recursos energeticos a traves de la creacion de una National Oil Company (NOC). Queda por ver si Argentina podra, al menos, igualar los logros obtenidos por YPF en los ultimos 13 anos. Se veia venir. Pese a que algunos comentaristas han atribuido la aparentemente inesperada decision de Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner de expropiar YPF �en la que Repsol tenia el 51 por cien� a una maniobra encaminada a paliar en parte la gestion economica de su gobierno, la espada de Damocles pendia desde hace anos sobre Repsol. La idea de recuperar lo que los argentinos llaman �soberania energetica� aparecia y desaparecia dependiendo de las coyunturas politicas del pais. Sea porque, como se dice, algun alto ejecutivo de Exxon Mobil le habria dicho a Fernandez que �la explotacion del shale gas de Vaca Muerta no era tan cara como decia Repsol (lo que habria enfurecido a la presidenta) o porque esta convencida de que no hay otro modo para aumentar las reservas y la produccion petrolera de Argentina que no fuera tomando el poder en YPF, lo cierto es que ella y su marido, el expresidente Nestor Kirchner, fallecido en octubre de 2010, nunca ocultaron su deseo de estatalizar o renacionalizar YPF. Tampoco es casual que haya tomado la decision unos meses despues de saberse que en 2011 Argentina habia tenido, por primera vez en mucho tiempo, un saldo negativo en su balanza exterior energetica, de 3.438 millones de dolares. Si a todo ello anadimos las dificultades economicas del pais y el nacionalismo de un pueblo que nunca acepto la venta de YPF a Repsol, tenemos el cuadro completo de lo que ocurrio..."
Asian Interests in the Arctic: Risks and Gains for Russia,2014,"In recent years, the Arctic has become a key area of interest for Russian domestic and foreign policymakers. Russia's renewed attention to the region and its readiness to spend enormous resources on development there have been driven by several closely interconnected factors. These include both the will to seize opportunities, primarily economic ones, as the Arctic opens up and the need to secure Russian sovereign rights in the region. Another factor has been the surge of interest in Arctic matters expressed by countries around the world, including by Asian states. This trend has fueled Moscow's determination to defend the Russian position against the perceived threat of being pushed out of the region by foreign actors eager to develop their own activities.For some time, Russia has been reluctant to accept increased influence in the region by non-Arctic actors that could potentially challenge Russia's status and interests. This coolness to newcomers applies to the Arctic Council's new Asian observers-China, Japan, India, South Korea, and Singapore-as well as to outside states and organizations in general. Although Russia intends to strengthen cooperation in the future, such cooperation is to occur on one condition: it must not challenge Russia's sovereign rights in the Arctic, including offshore areas.This essay analyses Russia's attitudes toward Asian interests in the Arctic. First, it examines Russia's key Arctic interests and policies and the challenges to their implementation. Next, it sheds light on Moscow's views on the admission of the five Asian states as observers in the Arctic Council, as well as on the motivations behind their policies toward the region. Finally, the essay analyses Russia's views on the actual and potential risks and gains as it seeks to balance mutually beneficial cooperation with the need to preserve its own influence, rights, and interests in the Arctic.Russia's Arctic Interests: New Opportunities, New UncertaintyRussian policy fundaments, the resulting Arctic strategy, and the plan for its implementation all draw on the country's relatively high-tempo socioeconomic and security development program and ambitions for the energy sector, strategic minerals and metals mining, maritime shipping, and fisheries.1 One of Russia's key strategic goals is the transformation of the Arctic into the ""foremost strategic base for natural resources"" by 2020. The expansion of the energy sector, which is monopolized by the national oil companies Gazprom, Rosneft, and more recently Zarubezhneft, has been moving forward, although dogged by delays. Some plans, including one to develop the Shtokman gas field in the Barents Sea, were canceled after the U.S. shale gas revolution altered the geopolitics of energy.Another fundamental Russian goal in the Arctic is development of the Northern Sea Route (NSR) as a major shipping artery to challenge traditional trade lanes between Europe and Asia. The use of the route for both transit and destinational shipping has risen systematically since 2009, and the government has high expectations for the future.2 However, the development of the NSR depends on the scope of economic development in the Arctic, even as many Arctic development projects depend on the availability of the NSR. To make Arctic shipping easier and safer, Russia has embarked on a large-scale plan to revitalize the passage through legislative and economic means as well as the use of security and military assets. Plans include construction of a new generation of icebreakers, modernization of search-and-rescue services, management of communications, development of navigation and surveillance systems, and development of a comprehensive dual-use coastal infrastructure that would serve Russian military and civilian purposes alike.As the Arctic becomes more accessible and the number of states and organizations active in it grows sharply, the region is seen by many in Russia as increasingly vulnerable. …"
Scientific assessments: Matching the process to the problem,2017,"Background : The science–policy interface process – known as a ‘scientific assessment’ – has risen to prominence in the past few decades. Complex assessments are appropriate for issues which are both technically complicated, multifaceted and of high societal interest. There is increasing interest from the research community that studies biological invasions to undertake such an assessment. Objectives : Providing the relevant background and context, the article describes key principles and steps for designing, planning, resourcing and executing such a process, as well as providing evidence of high-impact assessments enhancing scientific careers. Method : Experience from international and national assessments, most recently the South African scientific assessment for the Shale Gas Development in the Central Karoo, was used to develop this guiding generic template for practitioners. Analyses of researcher publication performances were undertaken to determine the benefit of being involved in assessments. Results : The key success factors for assessments mostly relate to adherence to ‘process’ and ‘governance’ aspects, for which scientists are sometimes ill-equipped. As regards publication outputs, authors involved in assessment processes demonstrated higher H-indices than their environmental scientist peers. We have suggested causal explanations for this. Conclusion : Effectively designed and managed assessments provide the platform for the ‘co-production of knowledge’ – an iterative and collaborative process involving scientists, stakeholders and policymakers. This increases scientific impact in the society–policy domain. While scientists seem concerned that effort directed towards assessments comes at the detriment of scientific credibility and productivity, we have presented data that suggest the opposite."
