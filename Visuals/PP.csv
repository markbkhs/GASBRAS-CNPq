‘We are not the Wild West’: anti-fracking protests in Romania,2015,"The protests against recent proposals for exploring and extracting shale gas in Romania are analysed. Examining the specific demands formulated by protesters, we investigate the articulation of a counter-discourse on the social control of natural resources and on the ecological risks involved in the shale gas industry. At the same time, the protests indicate a destabilisation of the post-communist neoliberal consensus by opposing the privatization and deregulation of natural resources. Using a critical political ecology framework, we identify the formation of a specific ‘technonatural’ environment of shale gas, which includes economic interests, political decisions and ideological representations specific to the neoliberalization of natural resources."
« Faire la politique soi-même » : le cas des mobilisations contre le gaz de schiste au Québec,2015,"The literature on activism characterizes the recent transformations of activism as part of a process towards the “personalization of politics”. For structural or cultural reasons, committed citizens appear to be developing a new relationship to politics, seeking personal satisfaction in their engagement. We propose an alternative interpretation, and characterize this transformation as “do-it-yourself” (DIY) politics. Based on the protests against shale gas development in Quebec, we show that the DIY politics is the “logical” (in the sense of rational) result of citizens developing the means to compensate for the lack of institutional opportunities in the context of developments that potentially threaten their lives and livelihoods. Hence, rather than a quest for personal fulfillment, DIY politics must be understood as a more prosaic and contingent reaction to a specific situation, an individual and collective response to a situation experienced and perceived as problematic. In the conflict surrounding shale gas development in Quebec, which serves as our case study, we show that 1) the initial impulse to mobilize may be accurately interpreted as moving from the “territory of the self” (“ territoire du moi ”) to the “territory of the us” (“ territoire du nous ”), and that 2) it is the double failure of institutional representation that underpins civic engagement: the failure of institutional representation and the lack of representation by collective actors already in place."
¨ A Dilemma of Abundance: Governance Challenges of Reconciling Shale Gas Development and Climate Change Mitigation,2013,"Shale gas proponents argue this unconventional fossil fuel offers a “bridge” towards a cleaner energy system by offsetting higher-carbon fuels such as coal. The technical feasibility of reconciling shale gas development with climate action remains contested. However, we here argue that governance challenges are both more pressing and more profound. Reconciling shale gas and climate action requires institutions capable of responding effectively to uncertainty; intervening to mandate emissions reductions and internalize costs to industry; and managing the energy system strategically towards a lower carbon future. Such policy measures prove challenging, particularly in jurisdictions that stand to benefit economically from unconventional fuels. We illustrate this dilemma through a case study of shale gas development in British Columbia, Canada, a global leader on climate policy that is nonetheless struggling to manage gas development for mitigation. The BC case is indicative of the constraints jurisdictions face both to reconcile gas development and climate action, and to manage the industry adequately to achieve social licence and minimize resistance. More broadly, the case attests to the magnitude of change required to transform our energy systems to mitigate climate change."
A framework for Social Impact Assessment of shale gas development in the Northern Territory,2018,This report is one component of a larger task to develop and pilot a framework for social impact assessment specifically relating to potential shale gas development in the Northern Territory (NT). The task was commissioned by the Independent Scientific Panel (the Panel) for the Inquiry into Hydraulic Fracturing in the Northern Territory and awarded to Coffey Services Australia (Coffey). Coffey engaged the team at the Centre for Social Responsibility in Mining (CSRM) at the University of Queensland’s Sustainable Minerals Institute to prepare this report.
A New York or Pennsylvania state of mind: social representations in newspaper coverage of gas development in the Marcellus Shale,2014,"What first comes to mind when you think of natural gas development in the Marcellus Shale region? The information and ideas we hold about shale gas development can strongly influence our discussion of this issue, the impacts we associate with it, and the types of regulation we view as appropriate. Our knowledge and beliefs are based in part on social representations—common sense understandings of complex, often scientific, phenomena, generated in the public sphere and reliant on the history, culture, and social structure of the context in which they emerge. In this article, we examine social representations of environmental, economic, and social impacts of natural gas development in the Marcellus Shale, as reported by major regional newspapers. We conducted a content analysis of newspaper coverage in two newspapers in the northern tier of Pennsylvania and two in the southern tier of New York from 2007 to 2011, with a total sample of 1,037 articles. Effects on water quality were by far the most prevalent environmental representation in each newspaper. Economic representations focused on jobs, leases, and royalties, but varied substantially across geographical contexts. Representations of social impacts were relatively rare in each media outlet. We also interviewed the journalists who wrote the most articles on shale gas development at each newspaper. Their perspectives provide some explanations for why certain impacts were mentioned more frequently than others, and for differences between newspapers. We conclude with implications for communicating about impacts associated with shale gas development, and for regulating development."
"A social take on unconventional resources: Materiality, alienation and the making of shale gas in Poland and the United Kingdom",2019,"Abstract Unlike conventional resources, unconventional gas (such as shale gas) is trapped in low permeability rock, from which it does not flow naturally. Hence, its extraction is costly and requires sophisticated technologies. Building on my ethnographic work in north-west England and south-east Poland, I explore people’s engagements with shale gas materialities to show how the category of an ‘unconventional resource’ – framed by geological and engineering sciences – has more than merely technological implications. Instead, shale gas produces new sociotechnical relations by trying to remove itself from social entanglements. These attempts fail to contain the unruly forces of the subsurface and local impacts, bringing the alienating dynamics of resource-making into sharp relief. The irregularities of materials and infrastructural limits, integral to the socially dis-embedded ‘unconventionality’ of the developments, inadvertently turn shale gas projects into a site of the political."
"A Socioenvironmental Shale Gas Controversy Scientists’ Public Communications, Social Responsibility and Collective Versus Individual Positions",2015,"In this case study, we analyze the discourse, practices and representations of a group of scientists who issued public statements about the French shale gas controversy. The reasons they gave for engaging in this process of communication focused on their social responsibility, their collective ad hoc expertise and the neutrality of their position. We also investigated how these scientists actually produced their communications, despite the tensions between individual and collective positions. We discuss how this experience led them to reflect both individually and collectively on their representations of science in society."
Attitudes Toward “Fracking”: Perceived and Actual Geographic Proximity,2017,"Prior surveys have sought to gauge American public opinion toward shale gas development. Research on environmental hazards has produced conflicting findings related to the role of proximity in predicting attitudes. This study analyzes how perceived and actual proximity to active shale gas development in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Texas predicts individual preferences for moratoria. We implement a conditionally parametric probit, which accounts for geographic variation in coefficient values. Our results suggest that attitudes toward the potential benefits and risks associated with shale gas development play a larger and more consistent role in predicting preference for moratoria than proximity or other sociodemographic factors. Our methodology allows for inferences related to the extent of geographic variation in coefficient values. Our results indicate that the role of proximity in predicting preference for moratoria differs based on whether a respondent resides in an urban or rural area or within a shale play."
Beliefs about impacts matter little for attitudes on shale gas development,2017,"Do facts lead to positive/negative views about energy development or vice versa? The answer matters crucially for policy and communication – if perceptions of what is true (beliefs) precede feelings (attitudes), additional information could shape views on an energy technology; yet, if attitudes precede beliefs, the usefulness of communication, either for influencing beliefs or simply making the public more informed, is far less clear. A long history of social-psychological research asserts that individuals’ beliefs predict their attitudes on environmental issues. Nevertheless, other theories intimate the reverse – attitudes shape beliefs, specifically on newly emergent, controversial topics. We investigated whether attitudes (i.e., support and opposition) about the contentious issue of shale gas development stem from or lead to beliefs about development. We collected data from random-sample surveys – of residents in the Marcellus Shale region and of a national US sample. Factor analyses and structural equation modelling lead us to question the dominant assumption that beliefs precede attitudes – the reverse, or a recursive relationship, appears more likely. Broad values and place attachment precede attitude formation more reliably than beliefs about impacts do – suggesting need for a larger focus in energy policy on core values and the ways in which development could foster or compromise these values."
Beyond Science and Hysteria: Reality and Perceptions of Environmental Justice Concerns Surrounding Marcellus and Utica Shale Gas Development,2016,"The debate surrounding the use of hydraulic fracturing (also known as “fracking” or “HF”) to extract natural gas from the Marcellus and Utica shale deposits is often characterized as a tension between economic development and environmental risks.  But frequently missing from this dichotomy is the fact that the concerns of many who oppose HF use extend beyond the purely “environmental,” and also include concerns about issues such as “the natural resource curse” and losing autonomy.  These concerns ring of “environmental justice” rather than “environmentalism.”  Environmental justice espouses the belief that no group should bear disproportionate environmental consequences resulting from industrial activity, and that people affected by industrial activity should be meaningfully involved in implementation.  Although some federal and state policies acknowledge principles of environmental justice, it has yet to be meaningfully incorporated into any legal framework in the United States. This Article argues that a nuanced characterization of the HF controversy should include a more robust discussion of both environmental justice and discourse in order to account for the inordinate burden residents of Appalachia have historically borne in fossil fuel production.  Part I examines relevant regional economic and social dynamics, including the natural resource curse, Appalachia’s unique vulnerabilities, efforts to portray opponents of shale gas development as “anti-science,” and the environmental justice movement’s relationship to extractive industries.  Part II reviews the use of modern HF technology and applicable legal frameworks in West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and New York.  Part III argues that across Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia, environmental justice issues have arisen from shale gas development, including problems stemming from information asymmetries, power asymmetries, and limited access to justice.  In Part IV, the Article argues that the “anti-science” portrayal of shale gas opponents is unjustified, and that such “discourse-framing” obfuscates the actual costs and limitations on benefits of HF use, and thus, becomes an environmental justice issue itself.  Part IV also argues that environmental justice concerns shaped public sentiment in New York, and that the resulting “moral outrage” added to New York’s policy decision to ban HF altogether.  In Part V, the Article suggests that ideas which transcend the study of “moral outrage”/risk assessment and environmental justice advocacy may offer a way forward."
Brexit and UK Energy Security: Perspectives from Unconventional Gas Investment and the Effects of Shale Gas on UK Energy Prices,2019,"Many aspects of the present and future effects on the UK economy, industry, and households, of Brexit have been researched. One thing which appears certain about Brexit is the shadow of uncertainty it casts on the future of business in the UK and its telling effects on the UK economy. It is believed that Brexit has negatively affected the level of investments in the UK, including investments in energy and crucially the upstream oil and gas, with the UK North Sea being starved of investments since 2014, leading already to increased energy bills. The UK is a net importer of natural gas—a major source of its energy, with some dependence on supplies from interconnectors from Europe. At the same time, UK energy companies participate in the common energy market which enables them to undertake arbitrage trading under the common market rules. However, both of these benefits could be lost under a Brexit scenario where the UK and EU come to a no-deal or hard border arrangement. Meanwhile, domestic production of energy in the UK has declined for nearly two decades now and import bills for natural gas are growing—they were £14.2 billion in 2017; £11.7 billion in 2016 and £13.4 billion in 2015—with Government projections indicating an upward trajectory for natural gas imports. It is however believed that the UK has great potential to exploit shale gas to her advantage in order to reduce her reliance on foreign energy which is: (1) less predictable in terms of supply and price affordability and (2) dependent on exchange rates—a primary means through which energy prices increased in 2016/17 post-Brexit referendum vote. The current study extends discussions on shale gas to cover a review of the potential of natural gas from shale formations to cushion UK households against further erratic gas prices due to Brexit and also assesses the potential effects Brexit may have had on the level of investments in shale gas, in order to suggest policy options for government consideration. Contrary to popular studies, we find evidence to suggest that shale gas has the potential to reduce energy prices for UK businesses and households at commercial extractions, under both hard and soft Brexit scenarios, but with more benefits under hard Brexit. Importantly, we find that from 2008 to 2017, average UK net export of natural gas was 5,191 GWh per year to the EU. We also find and argue that Brexit may have starved the nascent fracking industry of investments in a similar way it did to investments in conventional oil and gas and could have increased investor risk premium for shale gas development, the ultimate effect of which was a categorisation of fracking (company stock) as riskier asset for investors on the London Stock Exchange. We recommend that shale gas development be expedited to maximise its benefits to UK energy consumers post-Brexit or economic benefits from the resource could be diminished by rising operator costs due to delays and effects of the public’s perceived negative opinion of the method of extraction."
"Communicating Low‐Probability High‐Consequence Risk, Uncertainty and Expert Confidence: Induced Seismicity of Deep Geothermal Energy and Shale Gas",2018,"Subsurface energy activities entail the risk of induced seismicity including low-probability high-consequence (LPHC) events. For designing respective risk communication, the scientific literature lacks empirical evidence of how the public reacts to different written risk communication formats about such LPHC events and to related uncertainty or expert confidence. This study presents findings from an online experiment (N = 590) that empirically tested the public's responses to risk communication about induced seismicity and to different technology frames, namely deep geothermal energy (DGE) and shale gas (between-subject design). Three incrementally different formats of written risk communication were tested: (i) qualitative, (ii) qualitative and quantitative, and (iii) qualitative and quantitative with risk comparison. Respondents found the latter two the easiest to understand, the most exact, and liked them the most. Adding uncertainty and expert confidence statements made the risk communication less clear, less easy to understand and increased concern. Above all, the technology for which risks are communicated and its acceptance mattered strongly: respondents in the shale gas condition found the identical risk communication less trustworthy and more concerning than in the DGE conditions. They also liked the risk communication overall less. For practitioners in DGE or shale gas projects, the study shows that the public would appreciate efforts in describing LPHC risks with numbers and optionally risk comparisons. However, there seems to be a trade-off between aiming for transparency by disclosing uncertainty and limited expert confidence, and thereby decreasing clarity and increasing concern in the view of the public."
Community Leaders' Perspectives on Shale Development in the New Albany Shale,2015,"ABSTRACTShale development, which uses the controversial energy extraction technique of hydraulic fracturing, is on the rise in America, with industries recently investigating the New Albany shale play in southern Illinois and western Kentucky. We ask: what do community leaders in this region think about shale development generally, and how do they come to their decisions? To answer these questions, we interviewed eighteen community leaders, twelve of whom were proponents of shale development. We show proponents speak on shale development as a positive by claiming 1) any jobs are beneficial for the community, 2) shale development is not different from other forms of extractive industry, and 3) information that criticizes shale development or hydraulic fracturing is untrustworthy. Proponents come to these ideas by conceiving of their leadership roles strictly as economic leaders, and by pointing to their personal history in their communities to best know what development their communities need.Shale development, which consists of extracting natural gas through hydraulic fracturing (commonly called fracking) is on the rise in America with corporations and energy companies reaching out to more parts of the country where naturally occurring gas or oil shale plays exist. Even with recent lower costs of conventional oil energy, thus reducing the monetary value of shale gas and oil itself, unconventional gas development is still a major focus of extractive industries (Jacquet 2014; Theodori et al. 2014).While scientists undertake more evaluations of the relative safety and sustainability of hydraulic fracturing compared with more conventional energy extraction methods such as coal mining or oil drilling, companies have begun establishing shale development plants across North America in several plays like the Bakken in North Dakota and Montana, Eagle Ford and Permian Basin in Texas, and Marcellus in New York and Pennsylvania. Recently, energy companies have focused on extracting energy from a new shale play: the New Albany, in southern Illinois and western Kentucky.While this development is exciting for energy companies, landowners who may gain income from leasing mineral rights to their land, and individuals concerned with a potentially more sustainable energy source in America, there have been many problems associated with shale development generally, and hydraulic fracturing particularly (Jacquet 2014; Jenner and Lamadrid 2013). Environmentally, issues include the extraction process's use of toxic chemicals possibly contaminating soil and water (Finkel, Hays, and Law 2013), improperly treated wastewater flowing into and permanently damaging existing water supplies needed for farming and drinking (Kargbo, Wilhelm and Campbell 2010), and the fact that the drilling process itself uses millions of gallons of water per fracture (Soeder and Kappel 2009), which might deplete small towns' local water supplies. Socially, communities that depend on extractive industries have higher rates of unemployment, instability, and crime (Jacquet 2014). Communities involved with shale development have reported higher rates of crime, increased road usage by semi-trucks, and lower levels of quality of life (Boudet et al. 2013). These issues indicate that there are both negative and positive consequences associated with shale development, which must be weighed by governmental community leaders.Acknowledging these issues, we ask: what do community leaders in the New Albany shale think of shale development? Furthermore, how do community leaders come to their conclusions? In this piece, we present findings on interviews with eighteen community leaders in the New Albany shale play, with twelve self-declared proponents of shale development. We find three themes used by these proponents to back their stance: 1) any jobs are beneficial for the community, 2) shale development is not different from other forms of extractive industry they have had in the past, and, perhaps most important, 3) they cannot trust any information that criticizes shale development. …"
Comparing the relationship between knowledge and support for hydraulic fracturing between residents of the United States and the United Kingdom,2016,"Our work examines the relationship between knowledge/familiarity with shale gas development in a comparative context. The United States (US) and United Kingdom (UK) represent very different cases of shale gas development, with development relatively mature in the US whilst, no extraction of shale gas has yet commenced in the UK. Comparing results from two national level survey efforts in 2014, we find higher levels of knowledge about the shale gas industry in the UK than in the US, as well as higher levels of support in the US (opposition levels were similar, but US respondents were much less likely than UK respondents to say that they did not know whether they supported or opposed development). With respect to the relationship between knowledge and support, increased knowledge in the UK is associated with increased support, while knowledge was unrelated to support in the US. We anchor these results within the information deficit model of science, suggesting that concentrated media and governance in the UK have played an important role in producing the demonstrated effects."
Consultation is not consent: hydraulic fracturing and water governance on Indigenous lands in Canada,2017,"The rapid increase in private sector proposals and permit applications to use water for the purpose of hydraulic fracturing has led to significant concerns in nearly every jurisdiction in the world where shale gas development has been explored. In addition to concerns about risks to water quantity and quality, in Canada, shale gas development has highlighted how the Crown (federal and provincial governments) continues to struggle in its approach to honor, respect, and uphold Nation-to-Nation relationships with Indigenous peoples. But moving beyond the criticism, we argue that these circumstances have provided a renewed opportunity to explore alternative governance approaches. Existing water governance challenges are exacerbated by historical injustices generated by resource management approaches that have exposed Indigenous nations to disproportionate environmental risks. Furthermore, the inadequacy of current water governance approaches to recognizing Indigenous rights, self-determination, ways of knowing, and values has been well established in literature relating to environmental governance and Indigenous peoples. Given these circumstances, if water is allocated to hydraulic fracturing in Canada with continued disregard for Indigenous rights and risks, we contend that this only further intensifies unjust environmental and cultural harm to Indigenous peoples. In the quest for solutions, we discuss the challenges to alternative models (co-management, collaborative governance, and impact benefit agreements) that are frequently cited in environment-Indigenous literature. We conclude with recommendations to address the unresolved challenges inherent in these governance models, in the interest of improving water decision-making.

Coupling system dynamics analysis and risk aversion programming for optimizing the mixed noise-driven shale gas-water supply chains,2021,"Abstract Water management has increasingly become a hotspot in shale gas supply chains. This study develops a comprehensive modeling framework for the mixed noise-driven shale gas-water supply chains, which is integrated with techniques of system dynamics model and two-stage stochastic risk-aversion programming. White and colored noises are used for addressing stochastic characterization of shale gas productivity. Regional water resources carrying capacity is reflected based on the system dynamics model. The developed model cannot only effectively address stochastic parameters in the objective and constraints, but also offer a linkage between the pre-regulated policies and corresponding economic implications raised from improper policies. A Marcellus-based case in Pennsylvania is then performed to validate the applicability of the developed model. Results reveal that shale gas production curve is more sensitive to colored and mixed noises than white noise. High flowback and recycle rates would increase carrying capacity of shale wells by 1.8% in 2023. An increase in weighting factor (e.g., from 0 to 30) would induce a rise in system cost (e.g., from $1.22×1011 to $1.34×1011) but a reduction in conditional value-at-risk value (e.g., from $6.83×1010 to $3.83×1010). Weighting factor thus can be served as an indicator to show how much the decision makers’ attention to system risk."
Cumulative environmental and employment impacts of the shale gas boom,2019,"Natural gas has become the largest fuel source for electricity generation in the United States and accounts for a third of energy production and consumption. However, the environmental and socioeconomic impacts across the supply chain and over the boom-and-bust cycle have not been comprehensively characterized. To provide insight for long-term decision making for energy transitions, we estimate the cumulative impacts of the shale gas boom in the Appalachian basin from 2004 to 2016 on air quality, climate change, and employment. We find that air quality impacts (1200 to 4600 deaths; $23B +99%/-164%) and employment impacts (469,000 job-years ±30%; $21B ±30%) follow the boom-and-bust cycle, while climate impacts ($12B to $94B) persist for generations well beyond the period of natural gas activity. Employment effects concentrate in rural areas where production occurs. However, almost half of cumulative premature mortality due to air pollution is downwind of these areas, occurring in urban regions of the Northeast. The cumulative temperature impacts of methane and carbon dioxide over a 30-year time horizon are nearly equivalent, but over the long term, the cumulative climate impact is largely due to carbon dioxide. We estimate that a tax on production of $2 per thousand cubic foot (+172%/-76%) would compensate for cumulative climate and air quality externalities across the supply chain."
"Deliberating the perceived risks, benefits, and societal implications of shale gas and oil extraction by hydraulic fracturing in the US and UK",2017,"Shale gas and oil production in the US has increased rapidly in the past decade, while interest in prospective development has also arisen in the UK. In both countries, shale resources and the method of their extraction (hydraulic fracturing, or ‘fracking’) have been met with opposition amid concerns about impacts on water, greenhouse gas emissions, and health effects. Here we report the findings of a qualitative, cross-national deliberation study of public perceptions of shale development in UK and US locations not yet subject to extensive shale development. When presented with a carefully calibrated range of risks and benefits, participants’ discourse focused on risks or doubts about benefits, and potential impacts were viewed as inequitably distributed. Participants drew on direct, place-based experiences as well as national contexts in deliberating shale development. These findings suggest that shale gas development already evokes a similar ‘signature’ of risk across the US and UK. Shale gas and oil production and prospective development are increasing, but methods for shale extraction (‘fracking’) have been met with opposition. This study shows that informed discourse around shale development focussed on risks or doubts about benefits in a similar manner across the US and UK."
Drilling into controversy: the educational complexity of shale gas development,2014,"Potential development of shale gas presents a complicated and controversial education problem. Research on human learning and our own experiences as educators support the conclusion that traditional, disciplinary-focused educational experiences are insufficient due to the nature of the concepts necessary for understanding the development of shale gas within the energy system as a complex, contextualized phenomenon. Educators engaging in communicating complex phenomena such as shale gas development can also increase sophistication of learner understanding by taking into account the sociocultural and psychological mechanisms that shape one’s understanding of the change processes at work. We therefore review an emerging body of research showing that nurturing environmental literacy requires more than the clear explication of evidence, and instead requires interrogating one’s existing worldview and comparing alternative options for action, as opposed to analyzing energy options in isolation. We then apply the results of this research to the challenging task of creating meaningful learning experiences and engagement with complex issues such as emerging energy systems and shale gas development in particular."
Eliciting public concerns about an emerging energy technology: The case of unconventional shale gas development in the United States,2015,"Abstract Development of shale gas resources using hydraulic fracturing has dramatically increased U.S. gas production, but also created new needs for risk analysis and governance. Risk analysis for an emerging technology has traditionally relied on experts with knowledge of the technology and its anticipated impacts. But today it is accepted that input from non-expert interested and affected parties (IAPs) is also essential. We present a novel method to elicit concerns from IAPs about the development of shale gas resources. We used an Internet-based snowball sample to identify IAPs and an open-ended prompt to gather their concerns. Reported concerns included potential consequences for environmental, social, and health systems, as well as hazards, hazardous events, precursors to hazards, risk amplifiers, and issues concerning the effective and fair governance of the risks. Some concerns raised have not been addressed in expert-led analyses of shale gas risks. Long-term consequences such as disruptions to economic activities, and governance issues such as regulatory capacity, were more prominent in the responses than in expert analyses. These findings show how engagement with interested and affected parties can elucidate key issues for risk governance in shale gas development. The method can also be applied to other emerging energy development issues."
Ensuring benefits from North American shale gas development: Towards a research agenda,2014,"Abstract The North American shale gas “revolution” provides tremendous opportunities, but our scientific understanding of this transition and its potential near- and long-term social, economic, and environmental impacts lags behind the rapid pace of change. Investors, policy makers, and other stakeholders need greater clarity to make robust decisions in today’s dynamic natural gas sector. A comprehensive, interdisciplinary research agenda can help inform these decisions."
Ethics and ‘fracking’: A review of (the limited) moral thought on shale gas development,2016,"Whilst claims about the ethicality of shale gas development via hydraulic fracturing (‘fracking’) are commonplace in everyday discourse, little scholarly attention has been afforded explicitly to this aspect of unconventional fossil fuel extraction. The limited research that speaks to ethical considerations largely describes ethical concerns associated with development – extremely few claims in research literature make an ethical case for development. The most common ethical concerns cited in research stem from issues of distributive justice, with procedural justice, the precautionary principle, exposure to involuntary risks, rights-based arguments, and changes in community character and way of life as next most common. Additional research hints implicitly at ethical dilemmas associated with shale gas development, but does not openly identify these issues as having moral implications. Many ethical considerations relate closely to concerns about water quality and the volume/supply of water available for other purposes. The limited scholarship in this area reveals the import of understanding the ways in which ethics permeate thoughts about shale gas development for designing policy that responds to constituent needs and concerns. Even more limited than research on ethical claims in association with shale gas development is well-reasoned scholarship that analyses the extent to which ethical claims about development are well justified and philosophically justifiable. A comprehensive and systematic analysis of the range of ethical claims potentially relevant to shale gas development and their usefulness for informing policy on this topic would contribute greatly to informed decision-making on this controversial issue – something that science alone cannot achieve."
"Facts, Fiction, and Perception in Hydraulic Fracturing: Illuminating Act 13 and Robinson Township v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania",2014,"Hydraulic fracturing for oil and natural gas is perhaps the most polarizing energy issue in the United States and around the world, and Pennsylvania has emerged as an example of passionate views both for and against hydraulic fracturing for shale gas. To limit local government restrictions on gas drilling, the Pennsylvania legislature passed Act 13 in September 2012, and the Act largely eliminated the ability of local governments to restrict oil and gas operations through zoning. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court overturned Act 13 in December 2013. This Article reviews how Act 13 came to be, highlights the key provisions of the Act, and explains the various rationales used by the court to overturn the Act. The Article then takes a critical look at the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s reliance on unsupported facts and illustrates how even well-meaning assumptions applied to highly complex issues can cause more harm then good. The Article further argues that the court did not sufficiently analyze the full scope of environmental impacts of Act 13 and the related natural gas output that would accompany it. After the court decided to engage in the environmental analysis (rather than deferring to the legislature on policy matters), a detailed fact-gathering and analysis process was warranted to avoid adopting common misconceptions as legal facts. To be clear, this Article does not argue that the court was wrong to question the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing. Instead, it argues that the court’s decision failed to consider the full host of potential environmental risks related to energy extraction and production, which provide necessary context when considering the proper way to manage the corpus of the public trust and enforce the environmental protections mandated by the Pennsylvania Constitution. The Article cautions that a majority of the court appears to have relied on “fracking distractions,” which are real social or environmental risks that are incorrectly, and inappropriately, linked with hydraulic fracturing. Despite the court’s laudable focus on environmental protection, the Article also argues that the decision could cause unintended problems beyond the natural gas industry, unless future courts read the case narrowly. The Article concludes that a more tailored version of Act 13 may be feasible and that a renewed commitment to determining and analyzing the full complement of pertinent facts related to hydraulic fracturing is warranted and necessary to minimize potential environmental and social harms and to maximize potential benefits."
Fair fracking? Ethics and environmental justice in United Kingdom shale gas policy and planning,2017,"ABSTRACTThe exploitation of shale gas resources is a significant issue of environmental justice. Uneven distributions of risks and social impacts to local site communities must be balanced against the economic benefits to gas users and developers; and unequal decision-making powers must be negotiated between local and central governments, communities and fracking site developers. These distributive and procedural elements are addressed in relation to UK policy, planning, regulatory and industry development. I adopt an explicitly normative framework of policy evaluation, addressing a research gap on the ethics of shale gas by operationalising Shrader-Frechette’s Principle of Prima Facie Political Equality. I conclude that UK fracking policy reveals inherent contradictions of environmental justice in relation to the Conservative Government’s localist and planning reform agendas. Early fracking policy protected communities from harm in the wake of seismic risk events, but these were quickly replaced with pro..."
"Fracking and metaphor: Analysing newspaper discourse in the USA, Australia and the United Kingdom",2019,"Abstract We apply a mixed-method design centred on the deployment of metaphors to explore the role that language plays in the structuring of the public discourses of unconventional hydrocarbon development (UHD) across three major developed economies. We analyse UHD-related metaphorical devices deployed in broadsheet newspapers in Australia, the UK and the USA between January 2006 and May 2018. We develop an innovative Type Hierarchy Approach to metaphors by mapping through directed graph hierarchies. These allow concept-mapping analysis in terms of supertypes and subtypes, i.e. concepts ordered in terms of generality and inclusion as in “rapid expansion” → “explosion”. We find two broad discourses, each containing metaphorical constructions: economic gain across temporal horizons (incorporating boom, bonanza, revolution and death metaphors); and risk tolerance and decision-making (incorporating gamble and insanity metaphors). At the level of individual metaphors, deployment trends and patterns can be mapped along country borders rather than for example political alignment. Boom and bonanza appear most widespread in the USA, whereas UHD as a revolution is more closely associated with UK newspapers. Over time, UHD-related metaphor use decreases in all three countries, potentially reflecting an increasing public acceptance of UHD and moving shale gas from unconventional to conventional hydrocarbon development."
Fracking and public relations: rehearsing the arguments and making the case,2013,"Large-scale shale gas reserves have recently been discovered under many parts of the UK. Although the UK government and the business community have been very keen to stress the economic benefits associated with the development of these resources, a range of environmental organisations and community groups are vociferously opposed to such development. With this in mind, this research note describes the characteristics of shale oil and hydraulic fracturing, outlines the initial developments within the UK, rehearses some of the principal arguments and claims on the perceived benefits and costs associated with the hydraulic fracturing of gas shale resources and offers a discussion on how the case for and against shale gas development is being made. The discussion suggests that local opposition groups are well organised and have been harnessing information and communication technologies and social media to good effect. Within the shale gas industry, there is a consensus that managing and turning round widespread negative public perceptions about shale gas development will be essential if shale gas resources are to be commercially exploited. Public relations and media companies will have a key role to play in achieving that goal, but they face a range of testing challenges if they are to be successful.

Fracking bad language : hydraulic fracturing and earthquake risks,2020,"Abstract. Hydraulic fracturing, fracking, is a well stimulation technique used to enhance permeability to aid geological resource management, including the extraction of shale gas. The process of hydraulic fracturing can induce seismicity and the risk of seismicity is a topic of widespread interest and is often reported to be an issue of public concern regarding hydraulic fracturing. This is particularly the case in the UK, where seismicity induced by hydraulic fracturing has halted shale gas operations, and triggered moratoria. However, there seems a disconnect between the level of risk and concern around seismicity caused by shale gas operations as perceived by publics and that reported by expert groups (from industry, policy, and academia), which could manifest in the terminology used to describe the seismic events (tremors, earthquakes, micro-earthquakes). In this paper, we examine the conclusions on induced seismicity and hydraulic fracturing from expert-led public facing reports on shale gas published between 2012 and 2018 and the terminology used in these reports. We compare these to results from studies conducted in the same time period that explore public views on hydraulic fracturing and seismicity. Further, we surveyed participants at professional and public events on shale gas held throughout 2014 to elicit whether they associate shale gas with earthquakes. We use the same question that was used in a series of surveys of the UK publics in the period 2012–2016, but we asked our participants to provide the reasoning for the answer they gave. By examining the rationale provided for their answers we find that an apparent polarisation of views amongst experts is an artefact and in fact responses are confounded by ambiguity of language around earthquake risk, magnitude, and scale. We find that different terms are used to describe earthquakes, often in an attempt to express the magnitude, shaking, or risk presented by the earthquake, but that these terms are poorly defined and ambiguous and do not translate into everyday language usage. Such “fracking bad language” has led to challenges in the perception and communication of risks around earthquakes and hydraulic fracturing, and leaves language susceptible to emotional loading and misinterpretation. We call for multi-method approaches to understand perceived risks around geoenergy resources, and suggest that adopting a shared language framework to describe earthquakes would alleviate miscommunication and misperceptions. This work is relevant for a range of applications where risks are challenging to conceptualise and poorly constrained; particularly those of public interest where language inconsistency can exacerbate communication challenges and can have widespread consequence."
Fracking in the Karoo : approvals required?,2014,"The possibility of exploiting vast shale gas deposits in the Karoo Basin in South Africa by using a mining technique known as hydraulic fracturing, or ""fracking"", became a reality during 2008. The granting of a number of applications for licences to extract gas was met with stiff resistance on the one hand and enthusiastic reception on the other. All the uncertainties and controversies caused the Department of Mineral Resources to place a moratorium on licences and setting up a task team to get a better perspective on fracking through the publication of the Report on Investigation of Hydraulic Fracturing in the Karoo Basin of South Africa (2012). Since fracking has the potential to detrimentally affect the environment and water resources the main focus of the article is to indicate which permits, licences or authorisations are required before fracking can commence. Core components of the different approval processes are procedures for both public participation and the submission of some form of environmental assessment, programme or report. Prefacing this discussion is a brief examination of what fracking is, where shale gas deposits exist in South Africa and what the extent of such deposits is."
Framing Effects and Mobilization along the Marcellus Shale,2014,"How do social movements mobilize supporters to their cause? Social movement scholars have emphasized the importance of framing by media, political leaders, social movements, and other actors. While there is extensive research on framing in mass communication and the effect that media frames have on public opinion, there is less research on how framing may affect an individual’s willingness to mobilize for a cause. Some scholars have discussed the resonance of a frame for a target audience (Snow and Benford 1988). Others have argued that “mobilizing potency” may be a good proxy for frame resonance, because it taps into the ability of a social movement to gain supporters for protests, petitions, or other actions (Johnston and Noakes 2005). However, few studies have sought to systematically test the link between frame resonance and mobilization. This study seeks to fill that gap in the literature by testing the relationship between framing effects and mobilization. Using the case of shale gas development along the Marcellus Shale, this study employs both in-the-field interviews and an experiment that assesses how certain frames affect individual perceptions and their willingness to mobilize for a particular social movement. This study fits neatly in the intersection between the political communication and social movement literatures and contributes to both. In particular, it offers a link between framing effects and mobilization for social movement scholars, and further study on the production of frames and frames in competition to build on the political communication literature."
Health Impact Assessment of Shale Gas Extraction: Workshop Summary,2013,"Natural gas extraction from shale formations, which includes hydraulic fracturing, is increasingly in the news as the use of extraction technologies has expanded, rural communities have been transformed seemingly overnight, public awareness has increased, and regulations have been developed. The governmental public health system, which retains primary responsibility for health, was not an early participant in discussions about shale gas extraction; thus public health is lacking critical information about environmental health impacts of these technologies and is limited in its ability to address concerns raised by regulators at the federal and state levels, communities, and workers employed in the shale gas extraction industry. This report is the summary of a workshop convened in 2012 by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) Roundtable on Environmental Health Sciences, Research, and Medicine to discuss the human health impact of shale gas extraction through the lens of a health impact assessment. Eminent scientists, physicians, public health experts, and representatives from government agencies at federal and state levels, from nongovernment organizations, from the business sector, and from interest groups representing the interests of the citizens met to exchange ideas and to inform on hydraulic fracturing as a means of extraction of natural gas. This report examines the state of the science regarding shale gas extraction, the direct and indirect environmental health impacts of shale gas extraction, and the use of health impact assessment as a tool that can help decision makers identify the public health consequences of shale gas extraction."
"How much is enough? Approaches to public participation in shale gas regulation across England, France, and Algeria",2018,"Abstract We examine ‘fracking’ for shale gas extraction in England, France, and Algeria, framed from the perspective of level of acceptance by communities and general public. We explore the extent to which public participation in decision-making should play a role in fracking regulation, and evaluate whether the level of public participation matches the legal requirements. Our position on the adequacy of fracking regulation is from the perspective of the public dissenter, outlining a legal and normative basis for public participation in decision-making on fracking. We highlight relevant laws and policies to understand and evaluate adequacy of relevant regulatory processes. We offer strong yet nuanced argumentation, creating space for further discussion by academics, the public, regulators, local decision-makers, fracking companies and others. This is not a typical social-psychology, legal, sociology, or human geography research paper, as we take a position from the beginning: that the public ought to be involved in decisions related to the regulation of fracking, and argue that we validate our approach by supporting our claims throughout the work."
IMPACTOS SOCIALES DE LA EXTRACCIÓN DE GAS LUTITAS EN TAMAULIPAS,2008,"It is obvious that the wells for shale extraction will not be drilled at the corner of Insurgentes Avenue and Eugenia, where the Energy Secretariat is located. However, the centralist view of hydrocarbons policy in Mexico has aggravated the proliferation of blind spots. The book The energy reform in Mexico. Social impacts of the extraction of shale gas in Tamaulipas is a panoramic view towards the real horizon of what could happen in this state with the exploitation of shale gas. However, the perspectives offered by the book are not limited to a single point of view. Neither laudatory nor fatalistic, each author constructs a panorama after an exercise of argumentation based on the orderly observation of hard data. Far from rhetoric, and fatalism without substance, the chapters of this book bring the reader to a range of consequences that might arise from the exploitation of these hydrocarbons. At the moment, when these projects have not yet materialized, a collection of ideas whose object is the construction of useful knowledge could not be more opportune."
Learning from Lancashire: exploring the contours of the shale gas conflict in England,2017,"This paper explores the conflict over shale gas exploration in Lancashire where the company Cuadrilla is preparing to horizontally drill and hydraulically fracture the first shale gas wells in England. At present, this is the only location in Europe where new commercial exploration for shale gas is underway, thus the outcome has wider significance. The initial planning applications were refused by Lancashire County Council in June 2015. The decisions were then appealed by Cuadrilla and there was a public enquiry in February and March of 2016. On 6 October 2016, the central Government over-turned the initial decisions at one site and gave Cuadrilla more time to address traffic concerns at the other. The paper uses the public enquiry to map the contours of the shale gas conflict. It is divided into three sections. The first explores public attitudes towards shale gas development in the UK and reveals growing public awareness and increasing opposition. The second presents the conceptual frame for the analysis, which includes both a critical assessment of the social licence to operate (SLO) and an introduction to a social, actuarial, and political risk and licensing model (SAP Model). The third deploys the SAP model to analyse the public enquiry. The model explains how Cuadrilla is able drill despite the absence of both a local political and social licence to operate. It is concluded that unless the industry and the government can address growing public concerns about shale gas development, continuing conflict could constrain commercial development."
Looking through the prism of shale gas development: Towards a holistic framework for analysis,2016,"Abstract In consideration of the size and geographic concentration of proved conventional gas reserves and the potential role of natural gas to reduce the carbon intensity of energy demand, unconventional gas resources have become increasingly important to expand natural gas supplies. Shale gas in particular has gained international relevance in recent years, largely due to its rapid development and game-changing effects in the United States and its wider and larger distribution worldwide over conventional gas reserves; nonetheless, developing shale gas in other countries has been much slower, as it presents increased risks that span multiple interlinked dimensions and differ across the perceptions of an ample array of stakeholders in diverse contextual settings. The premises presented in this paper attempt to advance a holistic framework for shale gas development which comprises several factors grouped in three major interlinked domains: access to natural resources, industry capabilities and governance. To empirically test its premises under contextual variations, the framework is further used to consistently analyze the cases of Canada, China and Mexico. Findings confirm the interdisciplinary nature of shale gas development and suggest that governance is the most critical domain to bring about changes that improve the management of underlying risks."
New Trends and Challenges for Energy Geographies: Introduction to the Special Issue,2014,"In 1961, the Canadian geographer John D. Chapman recognized the rapid growth in demand for inanimate energy and the role geographers could be playing in explaining its patterns and importance in the growing world economy (Chapman, 1961). Fifty years later, Karl Zimmerer (2011) introduced a Special Issue of the Annals of the Association of American Geographers by noting that not only had Chapman’s prediction come true but that geographers were studying even a wider spectrum of energy challenges than Chapman could ever have imagined (see e.g. Dorian et al., 2006; Florini, Sovaccol, 2009). Many of those energy challenges were underscored at last year’s G20 summit in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Particular attention was paid to four concerns considered as crucial for global energy (OECD, 2013): phasing out fossil fuel subsidies (which encourage wasteful consumption, disproportionately benefit wealthier countries and sectors, and distort energy markets); price volatility (understanding and reducing temporal fluctuations and regional differences in commodity prices); market transparency (a necessity for accurate and timely energy data); and – last but not least – options of mitigating climate change (as the source of two-thirds of global greenhouse-gas emissions, the energy sector is crucial for achieving any climate change goals).By 2035, the world is projected to consume one-third more energy than today, while electricity demand should increase even by more than two-thirds (IEA, 2013). The centre of gravity of global energy demand will move decisively towards emerging economies such as China, India or Brazil, which should account for more than 90% of net energy demand growth. At the same time, however, it is estimated there will still be one billion people without access to electricity and 2.7 billion without access to clean cooking fuels in 2035, mostly in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa (ibid.). The current global energy market is characterized by rising differences in regional energy prices (depending on the availability of domestic resources and regional position within international energy flows), which have led to major shifts in energy and overall trade balances, as well as to energy expenditures taking a growing share of household income (IEA, 2013). The current political crisis in Ukraine and Russia´s chess operations with the supply of natural gas, have again emphasized the role of energy as an effective tool to influence international relations and maintaining political influence.During the last two decades, environmental and security concerns have led to a rapid and far-flung development of renewable energies. Modern wind power development, for example, now is found in over 100 countries, and solar power deployment is – in one form or another – in many more. Reaping the benefits of renewable sources has become a global ambition for several reasons, ranging from anxieties about climate change and energy security to the dangers of the atom. Indeed, the generous feed-in tariffs that Germany used to stimulate renewable energy development have been so effective that Chancellor Merkel was able to renounce Germany’s nuclear program after the Fukushima nuclear accident in 2011 (The Economist, 2011). Nonetheless, renewable energy development has been uneven around the world. Despite rapid and substantial growth in countries such as China, Germany, Spain and the United States, it still represents but a small amount of generation in most countries. For this reason, governments still need to consider other options, including cleaner use of fossil fuels, nuclear power, and new technologies such as shale gas fracking.All energy sources are characterized by potentially negative impacts, direct or indirect, manifesting themselves at different spatio-temporal scales. The economic costs of resources and the reliability of their supply are no longer the only criteria shaping political decisions and public opinions. Rather, perceptions of energy landscapes from renewable energy resources can be significant factors affecting: (1) national energy policies and their support by the general public (Leiserowitz et al., 2013); (2) acceptance of new energy facilities by local communities (Frantal, Kucera, 2009; Frantal, 2014; Pasqualetti, 2011a; Pasqualetti, 2011b; Soland et al., 2013, etc.); and even (3) customer loyalty in liberalized residential energy markets (Hartmann, Ibanez, 2007).The concept of what we call the “energy landscape” is one of the most intriging, important and challenging themes of the new geography of energy. Energy landscape is a term that has been commonly used for decades in physics and organic chemistry. In recent years, however, it has acquired a new meaning in the field of geography and landscape ecology (Pasqualetti, 2012). An energy landscape is a landscape whose images and functions (be they natural, productive, residential, recreational, cultural, etc.) have been significantly affected by energy development. Traditional energy landscapes include mines, canals, refineries and power plants, transmission lines, well fields and waste disposal sites, but more recently they have come to include expansive, whirling wind turbines and even the glare of solar central receivers in places like Ivanpah Dry Lake California (e.g. Nadai, Van der Horst, 2010; Zimmerman, 2014). In the broadest context, the range of what can be called an energy landscape is particularly expansive, though it may be used in the context of all branches of energy production and consumption with a geographic expression.Projects like wind farms, solar power plants, the cultivation of energy crops, biogas stations and other innovative technologies, have become effective means of realizing officially declared state-subsidized support for clean and sustainable energy. These projects, as well, can be objects of entrepreneurial interest among investors and developers, a potential source of income for communities involved (often located in less-favoured rural areas), and an alternative type of land use and source of profit for"
NiMbY or Not? integrating social factors into shale Gas Community Engagements,2013,"Shale gas extraction is an issue of significant local and national political controversy. It is widely recognized that engaging the public with both the science of fracking and with local siting processes is important in achieving public acceptance. The siting of shale gas facilities has become subject to both national and local political controversy, most recently in the United Kingdom, where concerns over localized seismic activity close to the northwestern town of Blackpool caused a temporary moratorium on Cuadrilla’s hydraulic fracturing activities and a political rethink of how unconventional gas reserves fit in to broader national energy policy. It is widely recognized that local opposition to hydraulic fracturing is one of the most significant obstacles to the expansion of the fledgling shale gas industry in Europe. This article looks at the social factors involved in not in my back yard (NIMBY) opposition. December 2012’s special issue of Natural Gas & Electricity explored this opposition in relation to community consultation and the NIMBY problem. This article is a response to some of the challenges raised in that special issue, and in particular I aim to flesh out some of the strategies raised in van der Velden and Schildmeijer’s early engagement and transparency approach1 and Severson’s social ecology approach,2 by translating some of the significant social scientific research on NIMBYism and community consultation in relation to wellestablished energy sectors (notably wind and nuclear generation) to the shale gas industry. The aim is to problematize this concept of engaging with “the public” on shale gas and, it is hoped, to help shale gas developers sidestep the pitfalls of ineffective communication practice by informing shale gas developers on how to avoid some of the pitfalls of bad process design."
"Not under my backyard? Psychological distance, local acceptance, and shale gas development in China",2020,"Abstract Shale gas development can negatively impact those residing in close proximity to projects. Evidence from protests in Europe and the United States suggests a growing prevalence of “NUMBYism” (Not Under My Backyard) sentiment. There is little public discourse about the public acceptance, particularly among those directly affected, of shale gas development in China. Moreover, little research has been done examining whether locally affected publics support or oppose shale gas development, putting policymakers at a disadvantage in terms of risk communication and effective energy governance. Through in-depth interviews with local residents (n = 25) in Weiyuan county that has the largest shale gas reserves in China, the present study extends prior literature on the “NUMBY” phenomenon by exploring local residents’ attitudes toward shale gas development, both locally and distantly. Here we find approximately 20% of our interviewees express views that are consistent with NUMBYism – oppose local development but support or are indifferent to development elsewhere. The rest express views that are fully supportive (52%) or opposed (8%) regardless of local or distant development, or indifferent to local development but either supportive or indifferent to development elsewhere (20%). We find interrelated factors such as national identity – not observed in previous studies – playing an important role in how residents view development. Moreover, drawing upon construal level theory, we also examine the role that different dimensions of psychological distance (e.g., social, temporal, uncertainty, and experiential) may play in explaining these views. These findings may inform policy design and risk communication about shale gas development in China."
Oil and Gas Consultation and shale gas development in British Columbia,2014,"As northeast British Columbia (BC) undergoes rapid change with the development of a globally competitive shale gas industry, the provincial government has a duty to consult First Nations on any developments that have the potential to infringe on their Aboriginal and treaty rights. This research investigates how the oil and gas consultation process is addressing, and might be improved to better address, Treaty 8 First Nations’ concerns regarding shale gas development within their traditional territories. Interviews were conducted with four Treaty 8 First Nations, the Treaty 8 Tribal Association, oil and gas companies, and representatives of the government of BC. In addition, participant observation was conducted with the Fort Nelson First Nation Lands Department during the summer of 2012. Research indicates that there are two overarching problems with the consultation process: the permit-by-permit approach, and the exclusion of First Nations from the decision-making process. In the absence of adequate provincial environmental regulation, lands departments are working to fill the governance gap, but lack the authority and capacity to do so. We conclude that resolving emerging conflict over the BC shale gas industry will require a restructuring of the governance system that includes early engagement, long-term planning, and cumulative impact assessment and monitoring, as well as meaningful engagement with First Nations in the decision-making process."
"On fracking in the Karoo, open forums and the power of public opinion... : environmental engineering",2011,"The debate around hydraulic fracturing in the Karoo is an issue of national and public interest. Shale gas extraction has the potential, some say, to change the face of the country's power industry and improve the lives of millions of South Africans. Public opinion, however, is a powerful force well known to have hampered the nuclear industry in the past"
On the complexity of ethical claims related to shale gas policy,2017,"In a recent article in Local Environment, Matthew Cotton (2017) lays out a foundation for what an ethical approach to decision making on policy and planning in relation to shale gas development could look like. This is the most comprehensive attempt in peer-reviewed academic literature to characterise and explicate the requirements and constraints on ethically-justified policy in relation to this contentious extractive industry. Cotton (2017) uses Shrader-Frechette’s (2002) Principle of Prima Facie Political Equality (PPFPE) to critique policy and planning decisions in the UK in relation to shale gas development. The PPFPE focuses heavily on distributive and procedural justice and gives particular attention to the need for: equitable compensation for any harms sustained, access to information about potential harms, and ability to participate freely in decision making processes (Cotton 2017). Cotton’s (2017) articulation of an ethical framework by which to evaluate the fairness and appropriateness of policy on shale gas development is a major step in the right direction. Evensen (2015, 2016a) has asserted that an explicit account of the circumstances under which development would or would not be ethically justified is perhaps the biggest gap in the policy discourse and debates on this issue. Indeed, there have been numerous public claims about the ethicality of ‘fracking’ (shale gas development), but until Cotton’s (2017) foray into this area, the academic literature on the topic was quite limited (Evensen 2016a). A few prior articles had highlighted distributive justice issues related to fracking (Cotton 2013, Evensen 2015, Fry et al. 2015, Hardy and Kelsey 2015, Hays and de Melo-Martin 2014, Hotaling 2013, Malin 2014, Measham et al. 2016, Willow and Wylie 2014), procedural justice considerations (Cotton 2013, de Wit 2011, Evensen 2015, Finkel et al. 2013, Fry et al. 2015), and/or the role of precautionary thinking in ethical approaches to evaluating unconventional gas development (de Melo-Martin et al. 2015, Finkel and Hays 2013, Law et al. 2014). Cotton’s (2016) article draws together the range of distributive and procedural justice considerations; as such, it is one of the most important social scientific or humanistic articles written to date on this much-debated form of energy development. It offers a solid point of departure for ethical thought on shale gas policy; nevertheless, there is more work to be done. Following Cotton’s analysis, aspects of the PPFPE arise as problematic or require additional clarification, including: the role of compensation in distributive justice, the definition of a ‘community’, the need for information provision, and the best way to ensure procedural justice. Two overarching issues that merit attention in relation to ethical thought on shale gas policy, but that were not addressed by Cotton (2016), are: (1) the role of shale gas development as just one means of energy extraction in a larger energy system – development does not occur in a vacuum – and (2) the role of virtue in determining ethicality of shale gas policies. I speak to these two issues and the four areas of Cotton’s argumentation requiring additional attention below."
"Opportunity, Ambivalence, and Youth Perspectives on Community Change in Pennsylvania's Marcellus Shale Region",2015,"Across vast swaths of mostly rural Pennsylvania, dramatic social, economic, and environmental transformations have occurred in the last five years as these regions have experienced a new natural resource boom in the form of unconventional natural gas extraction from the Marcellus Shale formation. While Pennsylvania's former Governor, Tom Corbett, and shale industry advocates hailed these developments as an economic godsend for Pennsylvania, others have raised serious concerns about the potential social, environmental, and economic consequences. In this paper, we examine youth perspectives in shale gas communities and how young people weigh their education and future prospects in light of local economic, environmental, and community change. We find that youth career decisions are often characterized by a deep ambivalence about the gas industry, its longevity, its capacity to provide desirable and local employment, and its ultimate effects on the livability and social sustainability of Pennsylvania's shale ..."
"Opportunity, Risk, and Public Acceptability: The Question of Shale Gas Exploitation in Québec",2014,"The Canadian province of Quebec has the largest reserves of shale gas in Eastern Canada, but Quebeckers are in the midst of a heated debate over the desirability of exploiting this resource. At issue is the controversial technique of hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking.” The provincial government has decided to proceed cautiously. In 2011, Quebec instituted a temporary moratorium, still in effect, on shale gas development in order to conduct consultations with experts and members of the public that has continued to present day. Recently, the government released the results of the experts’ report, the Strategic Environmental Evaluation. This paper highlights the report’s key findings about the potential economic benefits, environmental risks, and public acceptability of shale gas development. Quebec’s balanced approach to the complex, technical issue of shale gas development represents a deliberative approach to governance that emphasizes extensive public engagement."
Perception des risques au Québec – Baromètre CIRANO 2012,2012,"Certain public decisions, major projects or social issues in Quebec may give rise to concerns or fears. Whether we are talking about undertaking the refurbishment of the Gentilly-2 nuclear power plant, developing the shale gas industry, building a new bridge, retirement income, obesity, access to health services, some of these projects or issues are of concern to the people of Quebec. This book presents the results of an unpublished survey of a representative sample of the Quebec population. The CIRANO 2012 Barometer provides answers to the questions asked by all major project managers: - What is on the minds of Quebeckers today? - What are the projects and issues perceived as the most risky? - What is the level of trust placed by the population in the government for its management of 30 specific projects and issues? - What are the sources of information most used by the population? - How would the population react to the announcement, for example, of the construction of a new nuclear power plant?

Perception of the Natural Gas Industry and Engagement in Individual Civic Actions,2013,"ABSTRACTData collected in a general population survey from a random sample of individuals in Tarrant County, Texas, were used to empirically examine issues associated with public perception of the natural gas industry. Further, the associations of public perception of the energy industry with individual actions that (a) may or may not have been taken and/or (b) may or may not be taken in response to the exploration and production of natural gas were investigated. Echoing findings from research in two neighboring Barnett Shale counties (Theodori 2009), members of the public in Tarrant County appear to dislike certain potentially problematic social and/or environmental issues perceived to accompany natural gas development. Conversely, these same Tarrant County residents view less negatively the economic and/or service-related benefits that often result from such development. Moreover, the results of this study suggest that the social/environmental perceptual variable is a key factor in explaining past behaviors and predicting future behaviors taken in response to the exploration and production of natural gas. Possible implications of these findings are proposed.An extensive rural sociological literature exists on the social, economic, and social-psychological consequences-both positive and negative-associated with energy development (Jacquet 2009). The data for many of these studies were collected in the ""boomtowns"" of the intermountain West or in communities in the coastal region of Louisiana. Over the past five years, a new body of empirical research on energy development has begun to accrue in the rural sociological literature. These studies have focused on the experiences and perceptions of various stakeholders-including, but not limited to, community leaders, landowner coalition leaders, and members of the public-with respect to shale gas development (e.g., Anderson and Theodori 2009; Brasier et al. 2011; Jacquet and Stedman 2011; Schafft, Borlu, and Glenna 2013; Theodori 2009, 2012; Wynveen 2011).Shale gas development is a controversial form of energy development (Marsa 2011; Walsh 2011). At the center of the shale gas debate is the well stimulation/completion process known as hydraulic fracturing (Finkel and Law 2011; Rahm 2011). Shale gas development relies heavily on multistage hydraulic fracturing stimulation to maximize commercial viability. Wells are hydraulically fractured by flushing large quantities of ""frac fluid""-a mixture of freshwater, proppants, and small amounts of friction reducers and other chemicals-into them at extremely high pressure levels to create small cracks, or ""fractures,"" in the shale formations. Doing this allows natural gas to flow more freely through the reservoir and, in turn, increases recovery. Frac jobs commonly use 1 to 3 million gallons of water per gas well; in some cases, water use may exceed 5 million gallons per frac (Anderson and Theodori 2009). Numerous concerns have been raised over the amount of freshwater used by gas producers in the hydraulic fracturing process (Capozza 2009; Theodori 2009). Furthermore, fears continue to escalate over the potential contamination of surface waters and freshwater aquifers from the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process (Olmstead et al. 2013; Osborn et al. 2011).Despite this growing rural sociological literature consisting of contemporary attitudinal studies on shale gas development, surprisingly little research has been conducted on the individual actions that (a) may or may not have been taken and/or (b) may or may not be taken in response to the production of shale gas. The purpose of this research note is to extend the current scientific literature on the social issues associated with unconventional natural gas development (c.f., Theodori 2011). Here, using data gathered in a general population survey from a random sample of individuals living in one county in the Barnett Shale region of Texas, I examine the effects of public perception of the natural gas industry on six behavior-related dependent variables (i. …"
Public and Stakeholder Participation for Managing and Reducing the Risks of Shale Gas Development,2014,"Emerging technologies pose particularly strong challenges for risk governance when they have multidimensional and inequitable impacts, when there is scientific uncertainty about the technology and its risks, when there are strong value conflicts over the perceived benefits and risks, when decisions must be made urgently, and when the decision making environment is rife with mistrust. Shale gas development is one such emerging technology. Drawing on previous U.S. National Research Council committee reports that examined risk decision making for complex issues like these, we point to the benefits and challenges of applying the analytic-deliberative process recommened in those reports for stakeholder and public engagement in risk decision making about shale gas development in the United States. We discuss the different phases of such a process and conclude by noting the dangers of allowing controversy to ossify and the benefits of sound dialogue and learning among publics, stakeholders, industry, and regulat..."
Public and Workplace Safety and Health in Hydraulic Fracturing,2012,"Fracking, a universally recognised term, which refers to hydraulic fracturing of gas bearing rock layers allowing their gas to be released into specially constructed collection wells. Practiced in North America, Europe and Asia the growth of this industry brings environmental and public health concerns to the fore. In April 2012 the UK’s Department for Energy and Climate Change released an independent report, focused solely on potential seismological activity, which recommends stricter controls and procedures for developers extracting shale gas in the UK. Also in 2012 a North Carolina conference convened with the following objective; “to facilitate informed discussion to ensure that science-based policy decisions are made on energy development that will best serve the citizens …”. A symposium on emerging hazards, at the EU OSH Strategy conference 2012, discussed how existing hazards were reemerging in new industries, particularly the fracking industry. While much has been written and spoken about the scientific and technical aspects of fracking, issues such as public and workplace safety and health need to be thoroughly addressed if the debate and ultimately final choices are to be appropriately informed. The researchers preliminary scoping found concerns about; increased salinity of water supply adjacent to fracking sites, respirable crystalline silica dust in sand extraction sites, air and water quality, toxicity of drilling fluids and hazardous wastes. In this paper the authors adopt a multi-disciplinary approach involving value engineering, sustainability and ethics; exploring how functional aspects of engineering’s societal responsibility; delivering sustainable development through knowledge, skills and professional expertise, are being addressed.

"Public awareness and opinion on CCS in the province of Québec, Canada.",2012,"CO2 capture and geological storage (CCS) is a major topic of interest in Canada, where many CCS projects are either underway or in the planning stage. In order to get information about public acceptance for a potential CCS pilot project in the province of Quebec, two identical Internet-based public awareness and opinion surveys were conducted: one in 2010 and one in 2011. Results of the two surveys show that respondents are not really aware of what climate change is and that they know almost nothing about CCS. In 2010, respondents did not generally reject CCS technology or a potential pilot project in their region. In fact, they were slightly favorable toward such a project. In 2011, the picture changed slightly as an intense debate on shale gas exploration had taken place in the province at the end of 2010. It appears that respondents were less likely to be favorable toward the use of CCS. It is not possible to specifically link the increase of respondents against CCS or a potential pilot project and the increase of security concerns to the debate regarding shale gas exploration. However, the social context in a region where controversial shale gas activities are underway may not be the best for a potential CCS pilot project to become accepted by the local community. © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd"
Public opposition to shale gas extraction in Algeria: Potential application of France's ‘Duty of Care Act’,2020,"Abstract Algeria, a former French Colony, gained independence from France in 1962. It can be argued, however, that the legacy of post-colonialism continues, particularly with respect to the extractive industries. Both France and Algeria have large unconventional shale deposits—France has the second largest shale gas deposits in Europe after Poland and Algeria has the third largest in the world. Proposals to extract shale gas have led to widespread public opposition in both France and Algeria. The protests in France arguably led to the 2011 ban on hydraulic fracturing for shale gas, followed by the 2017 decision to ban all hydrocarbon exploration and extraction (unconventional and conventional) in French territory by 2040. Hydrocarbon company Total S.A., headquartered in France, has given up on operating in France but has now focused on potential development in Algeria, arguably an illustration of the continuation of a post-colonial relationship or NIMBY'ism (Not In My Back Yard). This perspective article aims to briefly highlight issues related to unconventional hydrocarbons in Algeria and introduce an emerging regulatory mechanism that could potentially provide a remedy to protect human and environmental rights and provide a model for future legislation in other countries. France's 2017 Duty of Care Act (Devoir de Vigilance) requires companies headquartered in France of a certain size to develop a ‘plan of care’ that mandates corporate responsibility throughout the supply chain and all subsidiaries, including outside French territory, and moreover provides a mechanism for legal recourse in the event of environmental or human rights harm from business activities."
Public Perceptions of Expert Credibility on Policy Issues: The Role of Expert Framing and Political Worldviews,2014,"How do individuals assess the credibility of experts in various policy domains? Under what conditions does the public interpret particular scientific knowledge claims as being trustworthy and credible? Using data collected from an online survey experiment, administered to 1,507 adult residents of Quebec, this paper seeks answers to these questions. Specifically, we examine variation in the way members of the public perceive the credibility of scientific experts in the areas of climate change, shale gas extraction, cell phones, and wind farms. Our results contribute to the existing literatures on public perceptions of policy experts, framing, and cultural theory. We find that individuals evaluate expert credibility based on the way in which experts frame issues, and on the congruity/dissonance between these expert communication frames and one's underlying worldview. However, we also identify limits to these framing effects. Our findings shed light on the interaction of framing and political worldviews in shaping public perceptions of expert credibility in various policymaking contexts."
Public perceptions of hydraulic fracturing for shale gas and oil in the United States and Canada,2017,"The United States and Canada have been at the forefront of shale oil and gas development via hydraulic fracturing. Understanding public perceptions is important given the role that they may play in future policy decisions in both North America and other parts of the world where shale development is at a much earlier stage. We review 58 articles pertaining to perceptions, published between 2009 and 2015. Studies report mixed levels of awareness of shale operations, tending toward higher awareness in areas with existing development. While individuals tend to have negative associations with the term ‘fracking,’ views on shale development are mixed as to whether benefits outweigh risks or vice versa: perceived benefits tend to be economic (e.g., job creation and boosts to local economies) and risks more commonly environmental and/or social (e.g., impacts on water and increased traffic). Some papers point to ethical issues (e.g., inequitable risk/benefit distribution and procedural justice) and widespread distrust of responsible parties, stemming from perceived unfairness, heavy-handed corporate tactics, and lack of transparency. These findings point to the contested, political character of much of the debate about hydraulic fracturing, and raise questions of what constitutes ‘acceptable’ risk in this context. We compare these results with research emerging in the UK over the same period. Future research should focus on nuanced inquiry, a range of methodologies and explore perceptions in varied social and geographical contexts. Both this and future research hold the potential to enhance public debates and decisions about shale gas and oil development.

Public perceptions of shale gas in the UK: framing effects and decision heuristics,2018,"Using two equivalent descriptions of the shale gas development process, we asked individuals to indicate their levels of support as well as their perceptions of the risks and costs involved. In version 1, shale gas development was framed as ‘fracking’, whereas under version 2 it was framed as ‘using hydraulic pressure to extract natural gas from the ground’. We find that individuals’ support for shale gas development is much lower when using the term ‘fracking’ as opposed to the synonymous descriptive term, and moreover, these differences were substantive. Our analysis suggests that these differences appear to be largely the result of different assessments of the risks associated with ‘fracking’ as opposed to ‘using hydraulic pressure to extract natural gas from the ground’. Our proposed explanation for these differences rests on the idea that shale gas development is a technical and complex process and many individuals will be bounded by the rationality of scientific knowledge when it comes to understanding this process. In turn, individuals may be relying on simple decision heuristics shaped by the way this issue is framed by the media and other interested parties which may constrain meaningful discourse on this topic with the public. Our findings also highlight some of the potential pitfalls when it comes to relying on survey research for assessing the public’s views towards complex environmental issues."
Public perceptions of shale gas operations in the USA and Canada: a review of evidence,2016,"M4ShaleGas stands for Measuring, monitoring, mitigating and managing the environmental impact of shale gas and is funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme. The main goal of the M4ShaleGas project is to study and evaluate potential risks and impacts of shale gas exploration and exploitation. The focus lies on four main areas of potential impact: the subsurface, the surface, the atmosphere, and social impacts. The European Commission's Energy Roadmap 2050 identifies gas as a critical fuel for the transformation of the energy system in the direction of lower CO2 emissions and more renewable energy. Shale gas may contribute to this transformation. Shale gas is – by definition – a natural gas found trapped in shale, a fine grained sedimentary rock composed of mud. There are several concerns related to shale gas exploration and production, many of them being associated with hydraulic fracturing operations that are performed to stimulate gas flow in the shales. Potential risks and concerns include for example the fate of chemical compounds in the used hydraulic fracturing and drilling fluids and their potential impact on shallow ground water. The fracturing process may also induce small magnitude earthquakes. There is also an ongoing debate on greenhouse gas emissions of shale gas (CO2 and methane) and its energy efficiency compared to other energy sources There is a strong need for a better European knowledge base on shale gas operations and their environmental impacts particularly, if shale gas shall play a role in Europe’s energy mix in the coming decennia. M4ShaleGas’ main goal is to build such a knowledge base, including an inventory of best practices that minimise risks and impacts of shale gas exploration and production in Europe, as well as best practices for public engagement. The M4ShaleGas project is carried out by 18 European research institutions and is coordinated by TNO-Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research"
"Public Trust in Environmental Decision-Making: A Case Study of Shale Gas Regulation in Kent County, New Brunswick",2018,"The existence of trust and confidence in public authorities and in the rules and the outcomes of environmental and other regulatory assessment processes is highly important. This case examines a region that was overwhelmingly distrustful of public authorities making decisions about shale gas development. Kent County is a rural area in New Brunswick, Canada, featuring coastal and inland villages and a unique mix of three cultures (Mi’kmaq, Acadian, and Anglophone). Through a combination of interviews (n=20) and a survey (n=500), we identified three main reasons for the lack of confidence: (1) skepticism over capacity; (2) scandals and controversies; and (3) challenges of aligning with indigenous epistemologies and questions of representation."
"Regional newspaper coverage of shale gas development across Ohio, New York, and Pennsylvania: Similarities, differences, and lessons",2016,"In communities experiencing shale gas development, the local media are an important information source on potential impacts of development; their coverage generates and spreads social representations of this issue. We examine representations of natural gas development through a content analysis of six regional newspapers in the northern United States (n = 1,958 articles) – two each in Ohio, New York, and Pennsylvania. Previous research showed similarities between the New York and Pennsylvania newspapers; differences emerged in nearby Ohio’s coverage. In Ohio, similar percentages of articles mentioned economic impacts as in Pennsylvania and New York, but significantly fewer articles mentioned environmental or social impacts. Furthermore, valence of economic and social impacts was notably more positive in Ohio. This analysis highlights nuances inherent in regional discourse about shale gas development. In turn, these differences have implications for: (1) how politicians, journalists, activists, and researchers can better communicate about shale gas development, (2) policy/regulation of development, and (3) future research on social representations of emergent forms of energy extraction. We suggest the need, in social science research on energy development, to examine societal-level (not merely individual) influences on perceptions and to account for nuances inherent in regional variation – infrequently manifest in national sample studies."
Resilient but not sustainable? Public perceptions of shale gas development via hydraulic fracturing,2017,"Complex energy development, such as associated with extraction and processing of shale gas, may affect the future sustainability and resilience of the small, often rural communities where development occurs. A difficulty for understanding the connection between sustainability, resilience, and shale gas development (hereafter “SGD”) is that definitions of sustainability and resilience are often muddled and unclear. Nevertheless, the ways in which development could affect sustainability and resilience have been discussed and contested in academic literature. Little is known, however, about the general public’s thoughts on how SGD relates to sustainability and resilience. Despite the overlap and conflation of these two concepts, research indicates some differences between characterizations of the two. While acknowledging difficulties in defining the terms, we included questions on a few broad attributes of the two concepts in a survey (n=1202) of a random sample of residents in the Marcellus Shale region of NY and PA, to explore the relationship between support for / opposition to SGD and perceived importance of community sustainability and resilience. Our survey revealed that beliefs about the importance of sustainability, as measured by three items that clearly pool together as a single factor, are associated with opposition to SGD; beliefs about the importance of resilience, measured by four clearly-connected items, are associated with support for SGD. This finding is particularly intriguing and relevant for communication and policy about sustainability and resilience in connection with energy development, because of the common conflation of the two terms."
Responsible Shale Gas Productions: Moral Outrage vs. Cool Analysis,2013,"The relatively sudden boom in shale gas production in the United States using hydraulic fracturing has provoked increasingly intense political conflict. The debate over fracking and shale gas production has become polarized very quickly, in part because of the size of the economic and environmental stakes. This polarized debate fits a familiar template in American environmental law, pitting “cool analysis” against “moral outrage.” Opponents of fracking have generally framed their arguments in moral or ethical terms, while systematic research is beginning to build a more careful and nuanced understanding of the risks associated with shale gas production (though the record is far from complete). All of which makes the question of how to produce shale gas “responsibly” – corporate social responsibility being the focus of this symposium – very difficult to answer. This essay argues that: (i) because shale gas production entails difficult to measure and unevenly distributed costs and benefits, there is no clear responsible (read: ethically preferable) set of limitations that we ought to impose on shale gas production; and (ii) moral outrage is obscuring (or influencing perceptions of) empirical facts in the shale gas policy debate. More specifically, well-established behavioral heuristics – particularly, confirmation biases and the cultural cognition of risk – are impeding the development of a common understanding of the empirical facts necessary to guide policymaking. Recognizing this, policymakers must resist political pressures and work that much harder to ground their decisions in empirically-demonstrated facts – namely, those produced by sources that are less susceptible to these heuristics and biases. Thus, information generated by rigorous, empirical analyses performed by academic or government sources ought to be credited over anecdotes or studies associated with industry or NGOs that have staked out a clear pro or con position in the fracking debate. Indeed, responsible fracking decisions ought to consider all of the consequences of permitting, regulating or banning shale gas production, including the relative risks of shale gas production compared with the relevant energy alternatives."
"Review of shale gas social science in the United Kingdom, 2013–2018",2018,"Abstract This article critically reviews social science research on unconventional hydrocarbon development in the United Kingdom. I analyse fifty research articles published over the last half decade. The articles fit into three primary categories: (1) public perceptions, (2) discourse and rhetoric, and (3) planning and regulation. This review reveals both what social scientific inquiry has taught us and what gaps remain. We have reasonable understanding of: extent of public support for and opposition to development, basic factors related to support and opposition, procedural and distributive justice concerns leading to opposition, repeated academic critiques of UK planning guidance and regulation, and the frequent use of environmental risks and economic benefits as competing discursive frames. We lack understanding of: how discourse and rhetoric about shale gas, or how knowledge about development, influence public perceptions; how perceptions and discourse at local and regional levels in the UK compare with the national level; what information sources the public rely on and trust on this topic; whether estimates of economic benefits are reliable; and importantly, how perceptions, discourse, and policy will evolve in light of imminent changes to the production and policy landscape. I conclude with recommendations for filling the emergent lacunae in our understanding."
"Scale matters: Variation in perceptions of shale gas development across national, state, and local levels",2016,"We explore the extent to which public perceptions of shale gas development vary across three survey samples—one each at: (1) national (USA), (2) state (NY and PA), and (3) regional levels (ten counties in the Marcellus Shale). We compare results from a survey of Marcellus Shale region residents (n = 1202) to those from a similar survey of a US sample (n = 1625), with an oversampling of residents from NY and PA (n = 516). A key difference between the local sample and the other two samples is that respondents’ beliefs about impacts of development explain much more variance in support for/opposition to development in the local sample. The beliefs about development that associate most closely with support/opposition vary across scale as well. Nevertheless, a few core values are important for predicting support/opposition across all samples. These results suggest a threshold effect in that local perceptions of shale gas development do not seem to extend far beyond the counties immediately affected by development. Construal level theory and social representations theory help explain why perceptions at the local level may differ from the regional and national levels. We consider implications for communication and social science research on energy development broadly."
Self-Reported Familiarity of Hydraulic Fracturing and Support for Natural Gas Drilling: Substantive and Methodological Considerations,2016,"Rapid development of the US natural gas industry over the last decade has been fueled primarily by technological advances in horizontal drilling and high-volume, multistage hydraulic fracturing (IEA 2012). Hydraulic fracturing - an industrial process frequently called fracking, fracing, or frac'ing - involves flushing large volumes of frac fluid (i.e., a mixture of water and proppant, along with small volumes of friction reducers, disinfectants, and other chemicals) into wells at extremely high pressure levels to create and/or magnify small fissures, or fractures, in the shale formations (King 2012; Theodori et al. 2014). The fracturing of shale gas formations increases recovery by enabling higher permeability through the reservoirs to the wellbores (King 2012).Of late, the topic of hydraulic fracturing has increasingly dominated public discourse and popular press writings (Dobb 2103; Marsa 2011; Walsh 2011). Environmental, social, and behavioral scientists have also begun studying various environmental/natural resource, social, and public health issues associated with increased hydraulic fracturing and shale gas and oil development (Colborn et al. 2011; Olmstead et al. 2013; Shonkoff, Hays, and Finkel 2014; Weber, Geigle, and Barkdull 2014). Citing both perceived and objective environmental and health concerns, lawmakers in municipalities across the country - and recently at a state level (New York) - have passed legislation banning the process of high-volume, multistage hydraulic fracturing within their jurisdictions.The purpose of this paper is to add to the sociological literature on issues associated with hydraulic fracturing. Recent studies have sought information on American's views of hydraulic fracturing from national samples of residents (Boudet et al. 2014; Davis and Fisk 2014) but do not focus on the views of residents living in areas such as Pennsylvania that are most affected by the rapid development of the natural gas industry. Other studies provide information on the views of selected stakeholder groups and community and/or key informants (Brasier et al. 2011; Ceresola and Crowe 2015; Ladd 2013; Schafft et al. 2014) rather than assessing residents' views directly. A 2009 survey of Pennsylvania residents in the Marcellus Region provided early baseline information about residents' perceptions (Alter et al. 2010), and a subsequent study (Willits, Luloff, and Theodori 2013a) documented changes in residents' views in the intervening years. The current analysis drew upon the latter survey data to assess residents' self-reported familiarity with hydraulic fracturing and its association with support or opposition to the development of natural gas. Specifically, the following research questions were addressed:Research Question 1: To what extent do residents report they are familiar with hydraulic fracturing and how does reported familiarity differ depending upon the individuals' sociodemographic characteristics, primary sources of information, density of well development in their counties, and the mode of data collection?Research Question 2: How does perceived familiarity with hydraulic fracturing relate to residents' support or opposition to development of the natural gas industry in their area?DATAIn 2012, random samples of persons living in 21 counties in the Marcellus Shale region in Pennsylvania were contacted and asked to participate in a survey concerning their opinions about natural gas development. All counties were located in the central core or tier one areas of the Marcellus region as defined by geologists at the time (Dell et al. 2008), and all had experienced at least some Marcellus Shale drilling activity. However, the well densities of the areas varied widely. Twelve of the counties contained between 1 and 128 wells in 2012, with 12 or fewer wells per 100 square miles of land area. The remaining nine counties each had two hundred to more than one thousand wells, with densities between 20 and 93 wells for every 100 square miles. …"
"Shale gas activity and increased rates of sexually transmitted infections in Ohio, 2000-2016.",2018,"Background The growing shale gas (“fracking”) industry depends on a mobile workforce, whose influx could have social impacts on host communities. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can increase through sexual mixing patterns associated with labor migration. No prior studies have quantified the relationship between shale gas activity and rates of three reportable STIs: chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis. Methods We conducted a longitudinal, ecologic study from 2000–2016 in Ohio, situated in a prolific shale gas region in the United States (US). Data on reported cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis by county and year were obtained from the Ohio Department of Health. All 88 counties were classified as none, low, and high shale gas activity in each year, using data from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. Annual rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated from mixed-effects Poisson regression models evaluating the relationship between shale gas activity and reported annual STI rates while adjusting for secular trends and potential confounders obtained from the US Census. Results Compared to counties with no shale gas activity, counties with high activity had 21% (RR = 1.21; 95%CI = 1.08–1.36) increased rates of chlamydia and 19% (RR = 1.27; 95%CI 0.98–1.44) increased rates of gonorrhea, respectively. No association was observed for syphilis. Conclusion This first report of a link between shale gas activity and increased rates of both chlamydia and gonorrhea may inform local policies and community health efforts."

Shale Gas and Hydraulic Fracturing in the Great Lakes Region: Current Issues and Public Opinion,2014,"This report presents the views of people living within the Great Lakes Basin regarding hydraulic fracturing and shale gas drilling. Hydraulic fracturing, the injection of a fluid after drilling to crack open shale rock to release oil or gas, has been used by industry for decades. However, recent breakthroughs in horizontal drilling techniques combined with hydraulic fracturing, have enabled oil and gas recovery from “unconventional” oil and gas reserves, previously considered inaccessible. This process is commonly known as “fracking,” which can refer to just the hydraulic fracturing process itself or the entire drilling process.As the developments in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling technology have produced an increase in oil and gas supplies, many states in the US and provinces in Canada are trying to determine how to leverage the associated economic potential. In response to this rapid change in the energy landscape and the potential future energy portfolios of the US and Canada, this report serves to provide background on shale developments within the Great Lakes Region — Ontario, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin — as well as a preliminary assessment of public opinion of fracking from residents within the Great Lakes Basin.This survey was part of a larger public opinion survey, which also assessed public views from the Great Lakes Region about environmental issues and policy in the Region as well as a closer look at policy related to wind power. These reports have been published by the Center for Local, State, and Urban Policy and are publicly available, among others, on related facets of this topic."
Shale Gas Development and Community Distress: Evidence from England.,2020,"This research examines psychosocial stress associated with shale gas development through the narratives of residents and the Revised Impact of Event Scale (IES-R). We carried out our research in three of England’s communities impacted by shale gas development. To gather data, we conducted qualitative interviews and engaged in participant observation in all three communities and conducted a quantitative survey of residents. From our qualitative interviews it was apparent that the residents we spoke with experienced significant levels of stress associated with shale gas development in each community. Importantly, residents reported that stress was not only a reaction to development, but a consequence of interacting with industry and decision makers. Our quantitative findings suggest that a significant portion of residents 14.1% living near the shale gas sites reported high levels of stress (i.e., scoring 24 or more points) even while the mean IES-R score of residents living around the site is relatively low (i.e., 9.6; 95% CI 7.5–11.7). We conclude that the experiences, of the three English communities, reported in the qualitative interviews and quantitative survey are consistent with the reports of stress in the United States for those residents who live in shale gas communities. We therefore suggest that psychosocial stress is an important negative externality, which needs to be taken seriously by local planning officers and local planning committees when considering exploration and development permits for shale gas."
"Shale gas development and community response: perspectives from Treaty 8 territory, British Columbia",2016,"Northeast British Columbia (BC), Canada, is the site of a fast-growing shale gas industry that is a cornerstone of the current provincial government's economic policy. In this paper, we explore the perspectives of local First Nations (members of Treaty 8) regarding governance of this industry, focusing in particular on the experiences of the Fort Nelson First Nation (FNFN). Based on findings from 15 in-depth interviews with staff from four Treaty 8 First Nations, the Treaty 8 Tribal Association, oil and gas companies, and the Government of BC, we argue that current governance processes fail to adequately protect the environment and treaty rights. We also explore the diverse tactics that the FNFN is using to gain influence over shale gas development within its territories as the Nation seeks to achieve “balanced development” that protects the local ecology and treaty rights while maximising local economic benefits. Through an array of tactics and collaboration with diverse actors, the FNFN has been partial..."
Shale gas development in the Great Karoo : the potential socio-economic impacts on the town of Beaufort-West,2012,"With the advent of shale gas exploration in the Karoo region, the purpose of this study was to investigate the possible socio-economic impacts of shale gas development on the town of Beaufort West in the Karoo. A qualitative study method was used to establish possible socio economic impacts by reviewing literature with regard to existing shale gas development as well as a case study from the United States of America (USA). A desktop study of Beaufort West was carried out to establish current socio economic trends in the town. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with key stakeholders to establish their concerns and opinion regarding the possibility of shale gas exploration and production in the area of Beaufort West in the Karoo. The results of the study concluded that the concerns of the key stakeholders were definitely relevant as their livelihood would be threatened if there was any possibility of contamination of their water sources. Other possible socio economic impacts included infrastructure concerns with regard to road maintenance, tourism declining and the threat of noise and air pollution. The study recommends that if the shale gas development process were to go ahead, the South African government would need to ensure that best practices are incorporated by all gas drilling companies. A team of qualified and trained regulators should monitor well pads and hydraulic fracturing methods as well as volumes of water used and the disposal of waste water. The regulations existing in the country should be revised to incorporate the stringent standards of other countries that have strict monitoring policies in place. In order to protect the people of the Karoo and the heritage of South Africa, the government must ensure that gas companies are held liable for any kind of environmental or socio economic impact."
Shale Gas Extraction in North Carolina: Research Recommendations and Public Health Implications,2013,"North Carolina has no history of large-scale commercial oil and gas extraction, and the state’s legislative framework for regulating drilling was, until recently, based on laws passed in the 1940s. However, areas of the state are likely to undergo horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing for natural gas and oil in the near future. North Carolina thus has a unique opportunity to produce a legislative framework that a) incorporates experiences from other states, b) includes state-of-the-art technologies and best practices, and c) protects the health of North Carolina’s citizens and ecosystems. Knowledge of the health risks associated with hydraulic fracturing is sparse. Some of the chemicals that can be used in the hydraulic fracturing process are toxic (Bamberger and Oswald 2012; Colborn et al. 2011). However, the concentrations of these chemicals used at a given well site are not disclosed in most states; thus, evaluating the risk of exposure and associated health impacts is difficult. Residents living < 1 km from hydraulically fractured wells are potentially at greater risk for health effects from natural gas development, which in some cases may include exposure to trimethylbenzenes, xylenes, and aliphatic hydrocarbons in air (McKenzie et al. 2012). These residents can also, but do not always, have higher concentrations of dissolved methane and other gases in their drinking water (Jackson et al. 2013; Osborn et al. 2011; Warner et al. 2013). In October 2012, the Research Triangle Environmental Health Collaborative convened a summit of experts from the oil and gas industry, nonprofit organizations, government agencies, and academia to consider the potential impacts of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing in North Carolina. The summit included three working groups that focused on potential outcomes related to hydraulic fracturing: exposure pathways, health impacts, and social impacts. The summit recommended actions and policies to safeguard the health of North Carolina’s citizens and environment if hydraulic fracturing occurs in the state (Research Triangle Environmental Health Collaborative 2013). The recommendations should also be useful for policy makers in other states. Summit participants discussed numerous recommendations, with three categories having the broadest support. First, the participants noted the importance of collecting comprehensive background data on air quality, water quality, and human and ecosystem health before oil or gas drilling occurs. Such data provide a baseline documenting current conditions that can be used to determine whether changes take place in the future, thus protecting both citizens and drilling companies from unfounded claims of damages. The quality and quantity of ground and surface water resources potentially affected by drilling should be studied, including analyses of major ions, trace metals, dissolved gases such as methane, radioactivity, and a range of organic compounds. Hydrocarbons from oil and gas wells should be characterized based on chemical and isotopic composition, which aids wastewater treatment and makes it easier to identify potential contamination if hydrocarbons are released into the environment. Ambient air monitoring of potential drilling areas should be performed because emissions from drilling sites may contain volatile organic compounds, particulates, and other contaminants. Ecosystem health, such as the identity and abundance of stream organisms, in the areas near drilling should also be assessed. Second, participants supported a comprehensive health impact assessment (HIA) as a means to monitor and avoid potential health problems in the future. An HIA should combine local-, regional-, and state-level medical and demographic data. Tracking of any health problems encountered in other states with hydraulic fracturing could provide early warning of heath problems that might occur in North Carolina and allow preventative action. Psychological and other stressors beyond direct chemical exposure should be considered, including sources such as increased road traffic and light and noise pollution. The HIA should also examine the potential economic costs associated with health impacts, including, for example, potential water remediation or increased rates of asthma. The third broad recommendation was to create a community needs and assets assessment (CNAA) to address potential social impacts. The CNAA should a) identify what jobs will be available to local workers, b) develop citizen stakeholder forums and reporting mechanisms, c) update transportation planning and safety training, and d) implement strong consumer protections. The working group on social impacts also recommended creating an ombudsman to facilitate communication between stakeholders and industry. For all three of these recommendations as well as for the many others included in the report (Research Triangle Environmental Health Collaborative 2013), it is important to clarify who is responsible for collecting such data and how to pay for it. One mechanism to ensure access for background data collection is to make gas well permits contingent on temporary site access for ambient air and water monitoring before, during, and after drilling and hydraulic fracturing. Policy makers might consider a bonding and remediation program to provide adequate cleanup, remediation, and maintenance funds. The cost of performing comprehensive environmental or health remediation should be considered in assessing bonding fees. Finally, it is important to decide—before drilling begins—how increased costs of infrastructure maintenance and staff will be apportioned. North Carolina has the opportunity to develop model programs and best-management practices for shale gas drilling and hydraulic fracturing. Our recommendations complement the work of North Carolina’s Mining and Energy Commission and can help North Carolina and other states protect the public’s health in areas undergoing unconventional oil and gas production."
Shale Gas—Community Relations: NIMBY or Not? Integrating Social Factors Into Shale Gas Community Engagements,2013,Shale gas extraction is an issue of significant local and national political controversy. It is widely recognized that engaging the public with both the science of fracking and with local siting processes is important in achieving public acceptance.
"Shale Gas: A Review of the Economic, Environmental, and Social Sustainability",2016,"The growth of the shale gas industry in the US has raised expectations that other nations could boost domestic gas production, leading to lower energy prices and improved energy security. However, the degree to which the US experience is transferable to other countries is uncertain. Furthermore, sustainability implications of shale gas development remain largely unknown. In an attempt to find out if and how shale gas could be exploited in a sustainable way, this paper reviews the economic, environmental, and social aspects of shale gas. These include costs, energy security, employment, water and land pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, earthquakes, and public perception. The literature suggests that it is possible to develop shale gas in a sustainable way, but its future will depend on the industry being able to address the environmental concerns, the political will to see the industry through to maturity, and public support, with the latter most likely being the biggest determinant."
Shale gas: Energy innovation in a (non-)knowledge society: A press discourse analysis,2015,"For years, technological innovations have been the cause of controversy. In reaction to this, increasingly often the bodies responsible for implementing these innovations undertake social dialogue with stakeholders. An important environment for this is media discourse, which defines the problems and key actors and disseminates strategies for argumentation. Effective communication on public policies is one of the challenges in deliberative democracy. This paper aims to analyse the role of experts and knowledge in reference to the models of public communication on shale gas. Using a qualitative press analysis, an incoherence was observed in the understanding of knowledge and the profile of experts and the models of communication using them. The communication, which is rather oriented towards persuasion without legitimisation of scientific factual knowledge, fails. Reference in the discourse to the unknown or uncertain directs attention to the issues related to the strategic exploitation of nonknowledge."
Social Acceptance in Energy Projects: Shale Gas in Poland—Case Study,2019,"Domestic energy systems are created and operate independently of the daily life of regular citizens. This helps minimise the risk related to new technologies and work performance. However, they affect the lifestyle of citizens and energy consumption structures. The energy policy is usually conducted in a paternalistic and centralised way, away from the social environment. Often times, rights of local communities are passed over during execution of energy projects. The objective of the chapter is to show importance of social acceptance in execution of new energy projects in the example of shale gas output in Poland and active opposition against it. The chapter is aimed at showing that local community becomes the key stakeholder in initiating local projects, and community consultations and dialogue with stakeholders become a determinant of success for innovative energy projects. Moreover, the author will attempt to defend the thesis that irrespective of the origin of the primary sources of energy fossil (nuclear or renewable), social acceptance is often the barrier for effective and efficient implementation of energy projects."
"Social impacts of earthquakes caused by gas extraction in the Province of Groningen, The Netherlands",2015,"Abstract Gas extraction from the Groningen gasfield in the northern Netherlands has led to localised earthquakes which are projected to become more severe. The social impacts experienced by local residents include: damage to property; declining house prices; concerns about the chance of dykes breaking; feelings of anxiety and insecurity; health issues; and anger. These social and emotional impacts are exacerbated by the increasing distrust Groningen people have towards the national government and the gas company, NAM, a partnership between Shell and ExxonMobil. The earthquakes have reopened discussions about the distribution of benefits from gas production and the extent to which benefits are retained locally. Mitigation of the impacts is attempted, but the lack of trust decreases the effectiveness of the mitigation measures. The extent of this experience of previously-unforeseen, unanticipated impacts suggests that a new social and environmental impact assessment needs to be undertaken, and a new Social Impact Management Plan (SIMP) and Impacts and Benefits Agreement (IBA) developed, so that the project can regain its legitimacy and social licence to operate. In addition to conventional gas, this paper has wider relevance for unconventional gas developments, for example shale gas extraction by hydraulic fracturing methods (fracking)."
Social sustainability assessment of shale gas in the UK,2018,"Abstract The majority of shale gas studies so far have focused on environmental impacts with few considering societal aspects. This paper presents a first and most comprehensive assessment of the social impacts of shale gas production and utilisation for electricity generation, focusing on the UK context. The assessment has been carried out based on 14 indicators, addressing the following social sustainability issues: employment, health and safety, nuisance, public perceptions, local communities, infrastructure and resources. Shale gas is compared to a range of other electricity options, including other fossil fuels, nuclear and renewables. Where appropriate and possible, the social impacts are evaluated on a life cycle basis. The results suggest that extraction and utilisation of shale gas would lead to a range of benefits, including employment opportunities and financial gains by local communities. However, these are limited and countered by a number of social barriers that need to be overcome, including low public support, noise, traffic, strain on infrastructure (e.g. wastewater treatment facilities), land use conflict and availability of regulatory resources. Furthermore, shale gas does not present a notable opportunity for increasing energy security, unless its production increases significantly above current predictions. These findings can be used by policy makers, operators and other shale gas stakeholders with an interest in the social impacts of shale gas development. The results can also be useful for other countries planning to exploit their shale gas reserves."
Stacked scale frames: building hegemony for fracking across scales,2015,"This paper introduces the concept of stacked scale frames and explains how they can legitimate a particular set of interests as general interests. Specifically, it examines how shale gas development proceeded in Pennsylvania, and finds that stacked scale frames were a tool for establishing the legitimacy of fracking. Fracking is a technique for extracting oil and natural gas from shale rock formations using highly pressurised water, sand and chemicals. It has produced dramatic amounts of gas and wealth over the past seven to eight years, but poses risks to the environment and public health that are largely understudied and misunderstood. Previous studies of fracking have explained the rise of fracking in Pennsylvania using analyses of advertisements and corporate promotional materials. This study builds on their work and adds an understanding of the fracking boom seen through the concept of hegemony. The data used in this paper draw from a set of interviews with ‘intellectuals’ in Gramsci's sense of the word: societal elites who mould and shape public opinion. In the case of fracking, these elites included representatives of oil and gas capital, the state, academia, NGOs and civil society living near fracking sites. Overall, the benefits of fracking were recognised by all groups and the costs were less commonly represented. This paper contributes the concept of stacked scale frames to literature on social production of scale in human geography. Stacked scale frames made capitalist economic development appear to benefit a wider section of society spread across multiple scales simultaneously. In contrast, opponents of fracking framed the costs of fracking at individual scales and in a piecemeal fashion. It concludes that anti-fracking forces, and political ecologists in general, should embrace a critique that draws together social and environmental harms across multiple scales simultaneously."
Stakeholder Concerns Against Shale Gas Developments in Europe - The Relevance of Water Management,2014,"The exploration of shale gas resources in Europe is moving at a slow pace, despite the fact that drilling for reservoir characterization is essential for any further planning. Whether shale gas development in certain regions is economically feasible at all and what such development activities might entail can’t be determined in the absence of critical data. Yet, there is widespread public resistance that influences political decision making and permitting, and that sometimes doesn’t even allow for exploration. Most of the stakeholders concerns are related to perceived environmental risks for water resources as a result of hydraulic fracturing. The main themes are concerns about the contamination of water bodies by fracturing chemicals, methane or flowback water, or concerns about the depletion of groundwater and surface water. While some of those perceived risks may be overestimated or unsubstantiated, there are real risks that have to be addressed by thorough assessments of the environmental, health and social impacts, and by an integrated approach to water management from sourcing to final disposal. This includes the transportation and distribution logistics for water and wastewater movements. It is essential to establish relevant reference and baseline data on groundwater and surface water systems well ahead of project implementation, to assess risks in a fashion that is understood by interested stakeholders, to define proactive and reactive resource protection measures, and to monitor performance. This paper suggests an integrated approach to water management that combines the elements of impact assessments, scientific and technical data gathering, and the monitoring of potential impacts across the life cycle of a shale gas project, as well as sourcing, transportation and disposal strategies. All results and measures taken need to be communicated and documented in a clear and transparent manner."
Summit Discusses Public Health Implications of Fracking,2013,"In the wake of the North Carolina state legislature’s July 2012 vote to legalize new oil and gas exploration,1 the state is poised to join the ranks of others already tapping into shale gas deposits with the help of hydraulic fracturing (fracking). But public and environmental health concerns, particularly those related to air emissions2 and drinking water safety and security,3,4,5 have sparked controversy in states such as Pennsylvania, where fracking is already being used to extract natural gas. At the fifth annual summit of the Research Triangle Environmental Health Collaborative, based in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, stakeholders worked in three breakout groups over two days to recommend best practices for policy makers, the fracking industry, and community members in this and other states.6 In summer 2012 the U.S. Geological Survey released an assessment of undiscovered oil and gas resources in North Carolina,7 which state geologist Kenneth Taylor says equals about five years’ current consumption for the state. Gas extraction in North Carolina’s Sanford sub-basin—the most promising area for drilling—has been projected to provide an average of 387 jobs per year over seven years.8 Meanwhile, research on the potential human health effects of fracking remains in its early days. The exposures workgroup cited needs for information on water availability, air quality standards (with guidelines for sampling and analysis), and potential ecosystem impacts, as well as for baseline health data about community members and gas workers. “North Carolina has the advantage of actually being able to do this since there is no prior history of oil and gas production,” says Scott Masten, a senior toxicologist in the National Toxicology Program Division of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. A participant in the exposures workgroup, Masten also delivered a plenary speech on federal government activities related to fracking. Potential health impact issues discussed included the need for comprehensive, ongoing health and demographic data collection, risk modeling, and public awareness campaigns, as well as a stable funding mechanism for all these endeavors. Discussion also centered on establishing best management practices for drillers (well standards, site design standards, inspections, etc.) to help safeguard public health. Hope Taylor, executive director of the nonprofit Clean Water for North Carolina, says there are tens of thousands of private well users in each of the counties that could potentially be affected by gas extraction. “We simply do not know, even in deeper shale formations, all of the conditions that would be required to carry out such operations to prevent contamination,” she says. “In North Carolina’s very shallow and discontinuous shales, groundwater supplies would be at greater risk.” Recommendations from the social impacts workgroup included identification of legal and physical impacts on landowners and others living near drilling locations, economic impacts to affected communities, and impacts to state and local infrastructure that would accompany the increased traffic, equipment, and activities associated with drilling. Hope Taylor pointed out that contractors, investors, pipeline companies, and large landowners would receive most of the economic benefits of development, whereas communities would bear most of the externalized costs related to noise, air emissions, potential drinking well contamination, traffic, and community disruption—a disconnect she said must be considered in impact analyses. According to Emily McGraw, state maintenance operations engineer with the North Carolina Department of Transportation, who participated in a state panel discussion at the summit, the Department of Transportation in Pennsylvania has been helpful with the infrastructural analysis process, providing guidance on permitting and bonding issues for hauling on rural roadways. “The biggest impact will be the weight of the loads coming in . . . [leading to] increased traffic and possible structural deterioration,” she says. Bernard Goldstein, professor emeritus of the Department of Environmental and Occupational Health at the University of Pittsburgh, says planning initiatives such as this summit and the recent Institute of Medicine Roundtable on Shale Gas Extraction9 are beneficial for states that may pursue fracking, and that the industry is getting better at dealing with environmental issues. Goldstein, who did not attend the summit, coauthored a recent EHP commentary on the current lack of a prominent role for the environmental public health community on the advisory boards making recommendations concerning drilling for natural gas.10 He says, “Technology that’s getting better over time has helped drillers do a better job of dealing with what comes up from underground—chemicals, brine, arsenic, radioactivity.” Dennis Devlin, senior environmental health advisor for Exxon Mobil Corporation, agrees. “To ensure that the economic benefits of unconventional gas development continue, our industry is committed to continue properly managing the risks involved with energy production,” he says. “This means meeting the highest standards of well design and integrity. We have rigorous standards in place to monitor and maintain wells after drilling is complete.” Given all the considerations that came out of the summit, would hydraulic fracturing be a feasible enterprise in the state of North Carolina? Yes, says state geologist Taylor, but feasibility would depend on satisfactorily addressing a host of key issues: the implementation of guidelines for hydraulic fracturing, adequate standards for gas well construction, rules on the reuse of wastewater, and the management of drilling waste. Goldstein agrees, and advises policy makers and stakeholders in North Carolina to practice caution, saying it would be best not to advance without more safety and technological advancements to protect public health. Rob Jackson, Nicholas Chair of Global Environmental Change at Duke University’s Nicholas School of the Environment and coauthor of a recent white paper on research and policy recommendations for fracking,11 summed it up for participants: “The best lesson we can learn from Pennsylvania is ‘don’t hurry.’ We need to make sure that we have strong rules and regulations in place, the resources for enough inspectors to do their job, and a commitment to keeping track of everything, from wastewater disposal to the chemical composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids.”"
"The economic, social and environmental impact of shale gas exploitation in Romania: A cost-benefit analysis",2018,"Abstract Romania has recently begun the exploration of shale gas reserves and, it is expected that these unconventional resources to be exploited by hydraulic fracturing. The use of this technology is controversial in high-populated areas, where the economic, social and especially the environmental impact is practically unknown. However, for the public opinion, the shale gas exploitation is presented as an operation triggering no major risks. Therefore, several agreements were concluded between the Romanian authorities and the major players in the exploitation field. Against this background, our paper shows that the shale gas exploitation has no real benefits for the Romanian citizens. More precisely, we conduct an exhaustive cost-benefit analysis, considering the economic, social and environmental consequences of the shale gas exploitation, and we show that in the long run, the costs considerably overlap the benefits. The use of hydraulic fracturing procedure, which implies huge costs with the water consumption and wastewater treatment, influences the outcome of our investigation. These findings are sustained by the sensitivity analysis we have performed."

The Psychological Process of Residents’ Acceptance of Local Shale Gas Exploitation in China,2020,"Local communities and their opinion on shale gas exploitation (SGE) play an essential role in the implementation of energy policies, while little is known about the reasoning process underpinning the acceptance of SGE. The present study develops a conceptual framework to examine the psychological process of residents’ acceptance of local SGE, in which the impacts of trust, knowledge, and fairness are mediated by risk and benefit perceptions. Structural equation modeling has been applied to analyze the hypothesized relationships based on a dataset of 825 households in China’s largest shale gas field. Our results indicate that residents’ perceived fairness and trust positively affect their benefit perceptions and negatively affect their risk perceptions, which results in positive influences on acceptance, and knowledge of SGE’s environmental impacts positively affects perceived risks, which results in a negative influence on acceptance. Moreover, residents’ acceptance is primarily determined by their benefit perception, followed by perceived fairness, and knowledge is the least important determinant. Thus, our study contributes to the literature by exploring the structural relationships between various psychological predictors and the acceptance toward SGE, and the results from our empirical survey provide insight into designing appropriate strategies in the process of generating and communicating shale policies."
UK public beliefs about fracking and effects of knowledge on beliefs and support: A problem for shale gas policy,2018,"Abstract This paper discusses a survey of public opinions on hydraulic fracturing (‘fracking’) for shale gas, conducted with a representative sample of 1745 British adults. Unusually, it examines beliefs about positive and negative statements about fracking as well as support/opposition. A majority of respondents correctly answered an initial question testing basic knowledge of shale gas extraction. More respondents supported fracking in Britain (36%) than opposed it (32%) but only 22% supported fracking locally, while 45% were opposed. Respondents were more united in negative beliefs than positive beliefs about fracking. More knowledgeable participants held more polarised views and were significantly more likely than others to agree with negative statements and to oppose fracking in their local area. More respondents disagreed than agreed that it is possible to compensate for fracking risks by payments to local communities. Policy implications include: increasing public knowledge about fracking will not necessarily lead to more positive beliefs and support regarding shale gas developments; promoting alleged economic benefits of shale gas is not enough to ensure support; engaging in genuinely inclusive participatory decision-making may be more likely to increase support than offering payments to communities; alternatively, developing more renewable energy capacity promises to be more popular than fracking."
"UK public perceptions of shale gas hydraulic fracturing: The role of audience, message and contextual factors on risk perceptions and policy support",2015,"There is growing recognition of the need to understand public attitudes to energy sources, such as shale gas, and to feed these into decision-making. This study represents the first detailed UK experimental survey of public perceptions of shale gas fracking, including analysis of the effects of different messages and the relative influence of different audience, message and contextual factors on support and risk perceptions in respect of shale gas fracking. Using an online survey (N = 1457) of the UK public, we find considerable ambivalence about shale gas, but also greater awareness of potential risks than benefits. Prior knowledge is associated with more favourable attitudes, although demographics, political affiliation and environmental values are strongest influences on perceptions. When provided with environmental or economic information about shale gas, participants became more positive – irrespective of their prior values or whether information is framed in terms of losses or gains. As expected, prior attitudes predict how information is received, with more attitude change amongst the most ambivalent respondents. We conclude that additional information about shale gas is more likely to be effective changing attitudes if focussed on this ’undecided’ group. Studies of this type are important for policy makers and industry alike."
Understanding public perception of hydraulic fracturing: a case study in Spain.,2017,"Abstract Public acceptance is crucial for the implementation of energy technologies. Hydraulic fracturing is a technology widely used in the USA for natural gas production from shale formations, but currently finds strong public opposition worldwide, especially in Europe. Shale gas exploitation and exploration have the potential to significantly reduce import dependency in several countries, including Spain. To better understand public opinion on this issue, this article reports a survey targeting both the entire Spanish population and the inhabitants of the province of Burgos, the location where shale gas exploration permits have already been issued. Results demonstrate that half of the Spanish population opposes shale gas, and this opposition increases in autonomous communities that are closer to possible exploration sites. The results also show that socio-demographic aspects are not strong predictors of opposition. In addition, Burgos' population show different behaviours toward shale gas that demonstrates that proximity and prospect of shale gas development affects opinion. Finally, there is still a great level of unfamiliarity with high volume hydraulic fracturing and shale gas in both populations sampled."
"Using Concepts from the Study of Social Movements to Understand Community Response to Liquefied Natural Gas Development in Clatsop County, Oregon",2019,"Shifts in natural gas supply and demand since the early 2000s have triggered proposals for import and export terminals in coastal locations around the United States. Demand for such facilities is likely to grow with increasing rates of natural gas exports. Clatsop County, Oregon, is one such location that experienced over 10 years of debate surrounding the development of these facilities. The first liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility was proposed in this area in 2004; the final was withdrawn in 2016. While residents expressed both support and opposition early on, opposition dominated by the end. Drawing on insights from the literature on social movements, we conduct a case study of community response to LNG proposals in Clatsop County. We show how opponents were able to successfully frame the potential risks of LNG in a manner that had strong community salience, allowing them to appropriate resources and create political opportunities to advance their cause and influence local and state decisions. Engaging with this case provides an opportunity to observe the behavior and decisions of both opponents and supporters over time, and how they affected project outcomes. LNG proposals in Oregon have been among the most controversial cases of LNG development in the United States. As shale gas development continues to grow, understanding the conflicts involved with its associated infrastructure is critical to creating a more just and equitable energy system."
Using ethnography to monitor the community health implications of onshore unconventional oil and gas developments: examples from Pennsylvania's Marcellus Shale.,2013,"The ethnographer's toolbox has within it a variety of methods for describing and analyzing the everyday lives of human beings that can be useful to public health practitioners and policymakers. These methods can be employed to uncover information on some of the harder-to-monitor psychological, sociocultural, and environmental factors that may lead to chronic stress in individuals and communities. In addition, because most ethnographic research studies involve deep and long-term engagement with local communities, the information collected by ethnographic researchers can be useful in tracking long- and short-term changes in overall well-being and health. Set within an environmental justice framework, this article uses examples from ongoing ethnographic fieldwork in the Marcellus Shale gas fields of Pennsylvania to describe and justify using an ethnographic approach to monitor the psychological and sociocultural determinants of community health as they relate to unconventional oil and gas development projects in the United States."
Using role play to explore energy perceptions in the United States and United Kingdom,2018,"Abstract We present the methodology and results of a role-play game that explored energy preferences and decision making criteria for a hypothetical town. Six day-long, mixed-methods workshops focussing on public perceptions of shale gas and oil development were held with highly diverse groups in four urban locations (Los Angeles and Santa Barbara, US; London and Cardiff, UK) and two rural locations (Hirwaun and Winford, UK), N = 83. As part of the workshops, small groups of participants assumed the role of town council members and were asked to debate and rank six energy infrastructure proposals (wind, solar, nuclear, shale gas, shale oil, and coal) in order of preference; a task that stimulated energetic, in-depth discussions around preferences, decision-making criteria, conditions and trade-offs. We reflect on how role-play methodology can be used to elicit insights into the nature of complex decision-making, as well as affording participants clarity and efficacy about decisions, and providing a novel platform by which to engage with energy conundrums. We also elucidate the challenges posed by inevitable disparities between role play and reality, and those associated with materials, framings, and group dynamics. Finally, we make recommendations for extending and refining the methodology, including participant-led framing and cautious consensus building."
Variation in beliefs about 'fracking' between the UK and US,2017,"In decision-making on the politically-contentious issue of unconventional gas development, the UK Government and European Commission are attempting to learn from the US experience. Although economic, environmental, and health impacts and regulatory contexts have been compared cross-nationally, public perceptions and their antecedents have not. We conducted similar online panel surveys of national samples of UK and US residents simultaneously in September 2014 to compare public perceptions and beliefs affecting such perceptions. The US sample was more likely to associate positive impacts with development (i.e., production of clean energy, cheap energy, and advancing national energy security). The UK sample was more likely to associate negative impacts (i.e., water contamination, higher carbon emissions, and earthquakes). Multivariate analyses reveal divergence cross-nationally in the relationship between beliefs about impacts and support/opposition – especially for beliefs about energy security. People who associated shale gas development with increased energy security in the UK were over three times more likely to support development than people in the US with this same belief. We conclude with implications for policy and communication, discussing communication approaches that could be successful cross-nationally and policy foci to which the UK might need to afford more attention in its continually evolving regulatory environment."
"Whose Backyard and What’s at Issue? Spatial and Ideological Dynamics of Local Opposition to Fracking in New York State, 2010 to 2013:",2016,"What drives local decisions to prohibit industrial land uses? This study examines the passage of municipal ordinances prohibiting gas development using hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) in New York State. I argue that local action against fracking depended on multiple conceptions of the shale gas industry. Matching these alternative conceptions with prevailing spatial models of public response to industrial land uses—“not in my backyard,” “not in anyone’s backyard,” and “please in my backyard”—improves our understanding of where local contention might emerge and how it contributes to policy change. Results from event history and logistic regression analyses show, first, that communities lying above favorable areas of the shale did not pass anti-fracking laws because opposition to fracking was counteracted by significant local support for development. Fracking bans passed primarily in a geographic sweet spot on the periphery of targeted regions, where little or no compelling economic interest in developmen..."
Exploring support for shale gas extraction in the United Kingdom,2016,"The development of shale gas in the United Kingdom (UK) using hydraulic fracturing, more commonly known as ‘fracking’, remains in its infancy. Yet understanding public attitudes for this fledgling industry is important for future policy considerations, decision-making and for industry stakeholders. This study uses data collected from the University of Nottingham UK nationwide online survey (n=3,823) conducted in September 2014, to consider ten hypothesises about the UK public’s attitudes towards shale gas. From the survey data we can see that 43.11% of respondents support shale gas extraction in the UK. Furthermore, our results show that women, class DE respondents, non-Conservative party supporters, and respondents who positively associate shale gas with water contamination or earthquakes are less likely to support the extraction of shale gas in the UK. We also discuss potential policy implications for the UK government arising from these findings."
Game-changing gas : deal activity,2011,"The early stages of the global shale gas revolution have deeply divided opinion. Environmentalists one side are fervently opposed to the fossil fuel, in particular the ""fracking"" mining process. They are opposed by the fulsome positivity shown by the energy industry and governments which see a ""game-changing"" opportunity to diversify energy streams while creating jobs. A third and less vocal element embraces those delivering the more balanced pleas of (pre)caution before damnation from scientists. Whichever way one looks at it, the situation is currently as clear as mud."

The article presents the results of research conducted among representatives of self-governments and partners of the Self-government of the Pomorskie Voivodeship at the background of the opinion of residents of the Pomerania region and the rest of the country. The research has been performed on the initiative of the Marshal of the Pomorskie Voivodeship at the turn of 2012 and 2013. The results point to a significant support for shale gas exploration in the Pomorskie Voivodeship and considerable expectations as it comes to benefits for gminas/poviats/residents related thereto. It is also clear that close cooperation between all stakeholders, dialogue and education are necessary elements in the process."
"One Step Forward, One Step Back: Shale Gas in Denmark and Sweden",2014,"Denmark and Sweden take two-fold positions on the question whether shale gas should be developed. At first sight, it appears the governments are supportive by licencing exploration to domestic and foreign companies. However, Denmark has suspended issuance of new licenses as doubts of extraction activities have risen. Sweden was forced to give landowners and municipalities a say in decision-making, and there is a larger context of mining minerals policy controversy. Even though both countries only have exploration activities at the moment, and the economic promise is yet unclear, public awareness and attention are increasing and cause difficulties for governments and industry to proceed without open discussions and debates. Scandinavia’s green image is at stake as the new fossil fuel opportunities are in conflict with the ambitious goals for renewable energy development. Both countries now have to prioritise energy self-sufficiency and industrial economics versus ecological consciousness.

Shale Gas in Europe: pragmatic perspectives and actions,2012,"Natural gas will continue to play a key role in the EU’s energy mix in the coming years, with unconventional gas’ role increasing in importance as new resources are exploited worldwide. As far as Europe’s own shale gas resources are concerned, it is especially the public’s perception and level of acceptance that will make or break shale gas in the near-term. Both the pros and cons need to be discussed based on factual argument rather than speculation. Research organizations such as ours (GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences) have an active and defining role to play in remedying this deficiency. As far as science and technology developments are concerned, the project “Gas Shales in Europe” (GASH) and the shale gas activities of “GeoEnergie” (GeoEn) are the first major initiatives in Europe focused on shale gas. Basic and applied geoscientific research is conducted to understand the fundamental nature and interdependencies of the processes leading to shale gas formation. When it comes to knowledge transfer, the perceived and real risks associated with shale gas exploitation need immediate evaluation in Europe using scientific analysis. To proactively target these issues, the GFZ and partners are launching the European sustainable Operating Practices (E-SOP) Initiative for Unconventional Resources. The web-based Shale Gas Information Platform (SHIP) brings these issues into the public domain."
"Shale Gas in New Brunswick: Promise, Threat, or Opportunity?",2012,"A petroleum industry has existed in New Brunswick for over 150 years but recent exploration for shale gas has unleashed an unprecedented wave of protest and opposition. This opposition is an international phenomenon that has followed the relatively new shale gas extraction industry from its origins in Texas, across North America and Europe. On the one hand, the extraction of natural gas from shale has increased reserves to the point where North America could become selfsufficient; on the other hand, opponents point to completely new hazards associated with this form of gas production. New Brunswick has the opportunity to devise a regulatory (and enforcement) regime that could minimize risk and maximize the benefits of a shale gas extraction industry. Public engagement in establishing this regime is essential, but the details, as this essay will illustrate, must be based on a rational and factual assessment of risk."
