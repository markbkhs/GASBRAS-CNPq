0,0,‘We are not the Wild West’: anti-fracking protests in Romania,2015,"The protests against recent proposals for exploring and extracting shale gas in Romania are analysed. Examining the specific demands formulated by protesters, we investigate the articulation of a counter-discourse on the social control of natural resources and on the ecological risks involved in the shale gas industry. At the same time, the protests indicate a destabilisation of the post-communist neoliberal consensus by opposing the privatization and deregulation of natural resources. Using a critical political ecology framework, we identify the formation of a specific ‘technonatural’ environment of shale gas, which includes economic interests, political decisions and ideological representations specific to the neoliberalization of natural resources.","‘We are not the Wild West’: anti-fracking protests in Romania The protests against recent proposals for exploring and extracting shale gas in Romania are analysed.

1,1,« Faire la politique soi-même » : le cas des mobilisations contre le gaz de schiste au Québec,2015,"The literature on activism characterizes the recent transformations of activism as part of a process towards the “personalization of politics”. For structural or cultural reasons, committed citizens appear to be developing a new relationship to politics, seeking personal satisfaction in their engagement. We propose an alternative interpretation, and characterize this transformation as “do-it-yourself” (DIY) politics. Based on the protests against shale gas development in Quebec, we show that the DIY politics is the “logical” (in the sense of rational) result of citizens developing the means to compensate for the lack of institutional opportunities in the context of developments that potentially threaten their lives and livelihoods. Hence, rather than a quest for personal fulfillment, DIY politics must be understood as a more prosaic and contingent reaction to a specific situation, an individual and collective response to a situation experienced and perceived as problematic. In the conflict surrounding shale gas development in Quebec, which serves as our case study, we show that 1) the initial impulse to mobilize may be accurately interpreted as moving from the “territory of the self” (“ territoire du moi ”) to the “territory of the us” (“ territoire du nous ”), and that 2) it is the double failure of institutional representation that underpins civic engagement: the failure of institutional representation and the lack of representation by collective actors already in place.","« Faire la politique soi-même » : le cas des mobilisations contre le gaz de schiste au Québec The literature on activism characterizes the recent transformations of activism as part of a process towards the “personalization of politics”.

2,2,¨ A Dilemma of Abundance: Governance Challenges of Reconciling Shale Gas Development and Climate Change Mitigation,2013,"Shale gas proponents argue this unconventional fossil fuel offers a “bridge” towards a cleaner energy system by offsetting higher-carbon fuels such as coal. The technical feasibility of reconciling shale gas development with climate action remains contested. However, we here argue that governance challenges are both more pressing and more profound. Reconciling shale gas and climate action requires institutions capable of responding effectively to uncertainty; intervening to mandate emissions reductions and internalize costs to industry; and managing the energy system strategically towards a lower carbon future. Such policy measures prove challenging, particularly in jurisdictions that stand to benefit economically from unconventional fuels. We illustrate this dilemma through a case study of shale gas development in British Columbia, Canada, a global leader on climate policy that is nonetheless struggling to manage gas development for mitigation. The BC case is indicative of the constraints jurisdictions face both to reconcile gas development and climate action, and to manage the industry adequately to achieve social licence and minimize resistance. More broadly, the case attests to the magnitude of change required to transform our energy systems to mitigate climate change.","¨ A Dilemma of Abundance: Governance Challenges of Reconciling Shale Gas Development and Climate Change Mitigation Shale gas proponents argue this unconventional fossil fuel offers a “bridge” towards a cleaner energy system by offsetting higher-carbon fuels such as coal.

4,4,A New York or Pennsylvania state of mind: social representations in newspaper coverage of gas development in the Marcellus Shale,2014,"What first comes to mind when you think of natural gas development in the Marcellus Shale region? The information and ideas we hold about shale gas development can strongly influence our discussion of this issue, the impacts we associate with it, and the types of regulation we view as appropriate. Our knowledge and beliefs are based in part on social representations—common sense understandings of complex, often scientific, phenomena, generated in the public sphere and reliant on the history, culture, and social structure of the context in which they emerge. In this article, we examine social representations of environmental, economic, and social impacts of natural gas development in the Marcellus Shale, as reported by major regional newspapers. We conducted a content analysis of newspaper coverage in two newspapers in the northern tier of Pennsylvania and two in the southern tier of New York from 2007 to 2011, with a total sample of 1,037 articles. Effects on water quality were by far the most prevalent environmental representation in each newspaper. Economic representations focused on jobs, leases, and royalties, but varied substantially across geographical contexts. Representations of social impacts were relatively rare in each media outlet. We also interviewed the journalists who wrote the most articles on shale gas development at each newspaper. Their perspectives provide some explanations for why certain impacts were mentioned more frequently than others, and for differences between newspapers. We conclude with implications for communicating about impacts associated with shale gas development, and for regulating development.","A New York or Pennsylvania state of mind: social representations in newspaper coverage of gas development in the Marcellus Shale What first comes to mind when you think of natural gas development in the Marcellus Shale region?

5,5,"A social take on unconventional resources: Materiality, alienation and the making of shale gas in Poland and the United Kingdom",2019,"Abstract Unlike conventional resources, unconventional gas (such as shale gas) is trapped in low permeability rock, from which it does not flow naturally. Hence, its extraction is costly and requires sophisticated technologies. Building on my ethnographic work in north-west England and south-east Poland, I explore people’s engagements with shale gas materialities to show how the category of an ‘unconventional resource’ – framed by geological and engineering sciences – has more than merely technological implications. Instead, shale gas produces new sociotechnical relations by trying to remove itself from social entanglements. These attempts fail to contain the unruly forces of the subsurface and local impacts, bringing the alienating dynamics of resource-making into sharp relief. The irregularities of materials and infrastructural limits, integral to the socially dis-embedded ‘unconventionality’ of the developments, inadvertently turn shale gas projects into a site of the political.","A social take on unconventional resources: Materiality, alienation and the making of shale gas in Poland and the United Kingdom Abstract Unlike conventional resources, unconventional gas (such as shale gas) is trapped in low permeability rock, from which it does not flow naturally.

7,7,Attitudes Toward “Fracking”: Perceived and Actual Geographic Proximity,2017,"Prior surveys have sought to gauge American public opinion toward shale gas development. Research on environmental hazards has produced conflicting findings related to the role of proximity in predicting attitudes. This study analyzes how perceived and actual proximity to active shale gas development in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Texas predicts individual preferences for moratoria. We implement a conditionally parametric probit, which accounts for geographic variation in coefficient values. Our results suggest that attitudes toward the potential benefits and risks associated with shale gas development play a larger and more consistent role in predicting preference for moratoria than proximity or other sociodemographic factors. Our methodology allows for inferences related to the extent of geographic variation in coefficient values. Our results indicate that the role of proximity in predicting preference for moratoria differs based on whether a respondent resides in an urban or rural area or within a shale play.","Attitudes Toward “Fracking”: Perceived and Actual Geographic Proximity Prior surveys have sought to gauge American public opinion toward shale gas development.

8,8,Beliefs about impacts matter little for attitudes on shale gas development,2017,"Do facts lead to positive/negative views about energy development or vice versa? The answer matters crucially for policy and communication – if perceptions of what is true (beliefs) precede feelings (attitudes), additional information could shape views on an energy technology; yet, if attitudes precede beliefs, the usefulness of communication, either for influencing beliefs or simply making the public more informed, is far less clear. A long history of social-psychological research asserts that individuals’ beliefs predict their attitudes on environmental issues. Nevertheless, other theories intimate the reverse – attitudes shape beliefs, specifically on newly emergent, controversial topics. We investigated whether attitudes (i.e., support and opposition) about the contentious issue of shale gas development stem from or lead to beliefs about development. We collected data from random-sample surveys – of residents in the Marcellus Shale region and of a national US sample. Factor analyses and structural equation modelling lead us to question the dominant assumption that beliefs precede attitudes – the reverse, or a recursive relationship, appears more likely. Broad values and place attachment precede attitude formation more reliably than beliefs about impacts do – suggesting need for a larger focus in energy policy on core values and the ways in which development could foster or compromise these values.","Beliefs about impacts matter little for attitudes on shale gas development Do facts lead to positive/negative views about energy development or vice versa?

9,9,Beyond Science and Hysteria: Reality and Perceptions of Environmental Justice Concerns Surrounding Marcellus and Utica Shale Gas Development,2016,"The debate surrounding the use of hydraulic fracturing (also known as “fracking” or “HF”) to extract natural gas from the Marcellus and Utica shale deposits is often characterized as a tension between economic development and environmental risks.  But frequently missing from this dichotomy is the fact that the concerns of many who oppose HF use extend beyond the purely “environmental,” and also include concerns about issues such as “the natural resource curse” and losing autonomy.  These concerns ring of “environmental justice” rather than “environmentalism.”  Environmental justice espouses the belief that no group should bear disproportionate environmental consequences resulting from industrial activity, and that people affected by industrial activity should be meaningfully involved in implementation.  Although some federal and state policies acknowledge principles of environmental justice, it has yet to be meaningfully incorporated into any legal framework in the United States. This Article argues that a nuanced characterization of the HF controversy should include a more robust discussion of both environmental justice and discourse in order to account for the inordinate burden residents of Appalachia have historically borne in fossil fuel production.  Part I examines relevant regional economic and social dynamics, including the natural resource curse, Appalachia’s unique vulnerabilities, efforts to portray opponents of shale gas development as “anti-science,” and the environmental justice movement’s relationship to extractive industries.  Part II reviews the use of modern HF technology and applicable legal frameworks in West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and New York.  Part III argues that across Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia, environmental justice issues have arisen from shale gas development, including problems stemming from information asymmetries, power asymmetries, and limited access to justice.  In Part IV, the Article argues that the “anti-science” portrayal of shale gas opponents is unjustified, and that such “discourse-framing” obfuscates the actual costs and limitations on benefits of HF use, and thus, becomes an environmental justice issue itself.  Part IV also argues that environmental justice concerns shaped public sentiment in New York, and that the resulting “moral outrage” added to New York’s policy decision to ban HF altogether.  In Part V, the Article suggests that ideas which transcend the study of “moral outrage”/risk assessment and environmental justice advocacy may offer a way forward.","Beyond Science and Hysteria: Reality and Perceptions of Environmental Justice Concerns Surrounding Marcellus and Utica Shale Gas Development The debate surrounding the use of hydraulic fracturing (also known as “fracking” or “HF”) to extract natural gas from the Marcellus and Utica shale deposits is often characterized as a tension between economic development and environmental risks.  But frequently missing from this dichotomy is the fact that the concerns of many who oppose HF use extend beyond the purely “environmental,” and also include concerns about issues such as “the natural resource curse” and losing autonomy.  These concerns ring of “environmental justice” rather than “environmentalism.”  Environmental justice espouses the belief that no group should bear disproportionate environmental consequences resulting from industrial activity, and that people affected by industrial activity should be meaningfully involved in implementation.  Although some federal and state policies acknowledge principles of environmental justice, it has yet to be meaningfully incorporated into any legal framework in the United States.

10,10,Brexit and UK Energy Security: Perspectives from Unconventional Gas Investment and the Effects of Shale Gas on UK Energy Prices,2019,"Many aspects of the present and future effects on the UK economy, industry, and households, of Brexit have been researched. One thing which appears certain about Brexit is the shadow of uncertainty it casts on the future of business in the UK and its telling effects on the UK economy. It is believed that Brexit has negatively affected the level of investments in the UK, including investments in energy and crucially the upstream oil and gas, with the UK North Sea being starved of investments since 2014, leading already to increased energy bills. The UK is a net importer of natural gas—a major source of its energy, with some dependence on supplies from interconnectors from Europe. At the same time, UK energy companies participate in the common energy market which enables them to undertake arbitrage trading under the common market rules. However, both of these benefits could be lost under a Brexit scenario where the UK and EU come to a no-deal or hard border arrangement. Meanwhile, domestic production of energy in the UK has declined for nearly two decades now and import bills for natural gas are growing—they were £14.2 billion in 2017; £11.7 billion in 2016 and £13.4 billion in 2015—with Government projections indicating an upward trajectory for natural gas imports. It is however believed that the UK has great potential to exploit shale gas to her advantage in order to reduce her reliance on foreign energy which is: (1) less predictable in terms of supply and price affordability and (2) dependent on exchange rates—a primary means through which energy prices increased in 2016/17 post-Brexit referendum vote. The current study extends discussions on shale gas to cover a review of the potential of natural gas from shale formations to cushion UK households against further erratic gas prices due to Brexit and also assesses the potential effects Brexit may have had on the level of investments in shale gas, in order to suggest policy options for government consideration. Contrary to popular studies, we find evidence to suggest that shale gas has the potential to reduce energy prices for UK businesses and households at commercial extractions, under both hard and soft Brexit scenarios, but with more benefits under hard Brexit. Importantly, we find that from 2008 to 2017, average UK net export of natural gas was 5,191 GWh per year to the EU. We also find and argue that Brexit may have starved the nascent fracking industry of investments in a similar way it did to investments in conventional oil and gas and could have increased investor risk premium for shale gas development, the ultimate effect of which was a categorisation of fracking (company stock) as riskier asset for investors on the London Stock Exchange. We recommend that shale gas development be expedited to maximise its benefits to UK energy consumers post-Brexit or economic benefits from the resource could be diminished by rising operator costs due to delays and effects of the public’s perceived negative opinion of the method of extraction.","Brexit and UK Energy Security: Perspectives from Unconventional Gas Investment and the Effects of Shale Gas on UK Energy Prices Many aspects of the present and future effects on the UK economy, industry, and households, of Brexit have been researched.

11,11,"Communicating Low‐Probability High‐Consequence Risk, Uncertainty and Expert Confidence: Induced Seismicity of Deep Geothermal Energy and Shale Gas",2018,"Subsurface energy activities entail the risk of induced seismicity including low-probability high-consequence (LPHC) events. For designing respective risk communication, the scientific literature lacks empirical evidence of how the public reacts to different written risk communication formats about such LPHC events and to related uncertainty or expert confidence. This study presents findings from an online experiment (N = 590) that empirically tested the public's responses to risk communication about induced seismicity and to different technology frames, namely deep geothermal energy (DGE) and shale gas (between-subject design). Three incrementally different formats of written risk communication were tested: (i) qualitative, (ii) qualitative and quantitative, and (iii) qualitative and quantitative with risk comparison. Respondents found the latter two the easiest to understand, the most exact, and liked them the most. Adding uncertainty and expert confidence statements made the risk communication less clear, less easy to understand and increased concern. Above all, the technology for which risks are communicated and its acceptance mattered strongly: respondents in the shale gas condition found the identical risk communication less trustworthy and more concerning than in the DGE conditions. They also liked the risk communication overall less. For practitioners in DGE or shale gas projects, the study shows that the public would appreciate efforts in describing LPHC risks with numbers and optionally risk comparisons. However, there seems to be a trade-off between aiming for transparency by disclosing uncertainty and limited expert confidence, and thereby decreasing clarity and increasing concern in the view of the public.","Communicating Low‐Probability High‐Consequence Risk, Uncertainty and Expert Confidence: Induced Seismicity of Deep Geothermal Energy and Shale Gas Subsurface energy activities entail the risk of induced seismicity including low-probability high-consequence (LPHC) events.

We show proponents speak on shale development as a positive by claiming 1) any jobs are beneficial for the community, 2) shale development is not different from other forms of extractive industry, and 3) information that criticizes shale development or hydraulic fracturing is untrustworthy. Proponents come to these ideas by conceiving of their leadership roles strictly as economic leaders, and by pointing to their personal history in their communities to best know what development their communities need.Shale development, which consists of extracting natural gas through hydraulic fracturing (commonly called fracking) is on the rise in America with corporations and energy companies reaching out to more parts of the country where naturally occurring gas or oil shale plays exist. Even with recent lower costs of conventional oil energy, thus reducing the monetary value of shale gas and oil itself, unconventional gas development is still a major focus of extractive industries (Jacquet 2014; Theodori et al. 2014).While scientists undertake more evaluations of the relative safety and sustainability of hydraulic fracturing compared with more conventional energy extraction methods such as coal mining or oil drilling, companies have begun establishing shale development plants across North America in several plays like the Bakken in North Dakota and Montana, Eagle Ford and Permian Basin in Texas, and Marcellus in New York and Pennsylvania. Recently, energy companies have focused on extracting energy from a new shale play: the New Albany, in southern Illinois and western Kentucky.While this development is exciting for energy companies, landowners who may gain income from leasing mineral rights to their land, and individuals concerned with a potentially more sustainable energy source in America, there have been many problems associated with shale development generally, and hydraulic fracturing particularly (Jacquet 2014; Jenner and Lamadrid 2013). Environmentally, issues include the extraction process's use of toxic chemicals possibly contaminating soil and water (Finkel, Hays, and Law 2013), improperly treated wastewater flowing into and permanently damaging existing water supplies needed for farming and drinking (Kargbo, Wilhelm and Campbell 2010), and the fact that the drilling process itself uses millions of gallons of water per fracture (Soeder and Kappel 2009), which might deplete small towns' local water supplies. Socially, communities that depend on extractive industries have higher rates of unemployment, instability, and crime (Jacquet 2014). Communities involved with shale development have reported higher rates of crime, increased road usage by semi-trucks, and lower levels of quality of life (Boudet et al. 2013). These issues indicate that there are both negative and positive consequences associated with shale development, which must be weighed by governmental community leaders.Acknowledging these issues, we ask: what do community leaders in the New Albany shale think of shale development? Furthermore, how do community leaders come to their conclusions? In this piece, we present findings on interviews with eighteen community leaders in the New Albany shale play, with twelve self-declared proponents of shale development. We find three themes used by these proponents to back their stance: 1) any jobs are beneficial for the community, 2) shale development is not different from other forms of extractive industry they have had in the past, and, perhaps most important, 3) they cannot trust any information that criticizes shale development. …","Community Leaders' Perspectives on Shale Development in the New Albany Shale ABSTRACTShale development, which uses the controversial energy extraction technique of hydraulic fracturing, is on the rise in America, with industries recently investigating the New Albany shale play in southern Illinois and western Kentucky.

13,13,Comparing the relationship between knowledge and support for hydraulic fracturing between residents of the United States and the United Kingdom,2016,"Our work examines the relationship between knowledge/familiarity with shale gas development in a comparative context. The United States (US) and United Kingdom (UK) represent very different cases of shale gas development, with development relatively mature in the US whilst, no extraction of shale gas has yet commenced in the UK. Comparing results from two national level survey efforts in 2014, we find higher levels of knowledge about the shale gas industry in the UK than in the US, as well as higher levels of support in the US (opposition levels were similar, but US respondents were much less likely than UK respondents to say that they did not know whether they supported or opposed development). With respect to the relationship between knowledge and support, increased knowledge in the UK is associated with increased support, while knowledge was unrelated to support in the US. We anchor these results within the information deficit model of science, suggesting that concentrated media and governance in the UK have played an important role in producing the demonstrated effects.","Comparing the relationship between knowledge and support for hydraulic fracturing between residents of the United States and the United Kingdom Our work examines the relationship between knowledge/familiarity with shale gas development in a comparative context.

14,14,Consultation is not consent: hydraulic fracturing and water governance on Indigenous lands in Canada,2017,"The rapid increase in private sector proposals and permit applications to use water for the purpose of hydraulic fracturing has led to significant concerns in nearly every jurisdiction in the world where shale gas development has been explored. In addition to concerns about risks to water quantity and quality, in Canada, shale gas development has highlighted how the Crown (federal and provincial governments) continues to struggle in its approach to honor, respect, and uphold Nation-to-Nation relationships with Indigenous peoples. But moving beyond the criticism, we argue that these circumstances have provided a renewed opportunity to explore alternative governance approaches. Existing water governance challenges are exacerbated by historical injustices generated by resource management approaches that have exposed Indigenous nations to disproportionate environmental risks. Furthermore, the inadequacy of current water governance approaches to recognizing Indigenous rights, self-determination, ways of knowing, and values has been well established in literature relating to environmental governance and Indigenous peoples. Given these circumstances, if water is allocated to hydraulic fracturing in Canada with continued disregard for Indigenous rights and risks, we contend that this only further intensifies unjust environmental and cultural harm to Indigenous peoples. In the quest for solutions, we discuss the challenges to alternative models (co-management, collaborative governance, and impact benefit agreements) that are frequently cited in environment-Indigenous literature. We conclude with recommendations to address the unresolved challenges inherent in these governance models, in the interest of improving water decision-making.

15,15,Coupling system dynamics analysis and risk aversion programming for optimizing the mixed noise-driven shale gas-water supply chains,2021,"Abstract Water management has increasingly become a hotspot in shale gas supply chains. This study develops a comprehensive modeling framework for the mixed noise-driven shale gas-water supply chains, which is integrated with techniques of system dynamics model and two-stage stochastic risk-aversion programming. White and colored noises are used for addressing stochastic characterization of shale gas productivity. Regional water resources carrying capacity is reflected based on the system dynamics model. The developed model cannot only effectively address stochastic parameters in the objective and constraints, but also offer a linkage between the pre-regulated policies and corresponding economic implications raised from improper policies. A Marcellus-based case in Pennsylvania is then performed to validate the applicability of the developed model. Results reveal that shale gas production curve is more sensitive to colored and mixed noises than white noise. High flowback and recycle rates would increase carrying capacity of shale wells by 1.8% in 2023. An increase in weighting factor (e.g., from 0 to 30) would induce a rise in system cost (e.g., from $1.22×1011 to $1.34×1011) but a reduction in conditional value-at-risk value (e.g., from $6.83×1010 to $3.83×1010). Weighting factor thus can be served as an indicator to show how much the decision makers’ attention to system risk.","Coupling system dynamics analysis and risk aversion programming for optimizing the mixed noise-driven shale gas-water supply chains Abstract Water management has increasingly become a hotspot in shale gas supply chains.

16,16,Cumulative environmental and employment impacts of the shale gas boom,2019,"Natural gas has become the largest fuel source for electricity generation in the United States and accounts for a third of energy production and consumption. However, the environmental and socioeconomic impacts across the supply chain and over the boom-and-bust cycle have not been comprehensively characterized. To provide insight for long-term decision making for energy transitions, we estimate the cumulative impacts of the shale gas boom in the Appalachian basin from 2004 to 2016 on air quality, climate change, and employment. We find that air quality impacts (1200 to 4600 deaths; $23B +99%/-164%) and employment impacts (469,000 job-years ±30%; $21B ±30%) follow the boom-and-bust cycle, while climate impacts ($12B to $94B) persist for generations well beyond the period of natural gas activity. Employment effects concentrate in rural areas where production occurs. However, almost half of cumulative premature mortality due to air pollution is downwind of these areas, occurring in urban regions of the Northeast. The cumulative temperature impacts of methane and carbon dioxide over a 30-year time horizon are nearly equivalent, but over the long term, the cumulative climate impact is largely due to carbon dioxide. We estimate that a tax on production of $2 per thousand cubic foot (+172%/-76%) would compensate for cumulative climate and air quality externalities across the supply chain.","Cumulative environmental and employment impacts of the shale gas boom Natural gas has become the largest fuel source for electricity generation in the United States and accounts for a third of energy production and consumption.

Educators engaging in communicating complex phenomena such as shale gas development can also increase sophistication of learner understanding by taking into account the sociocultural and psychological mechanisms that shape one’s understanding of the change processes at work. We therefore review an emerging body of research showing that nurturing environmental literacy requires more than the clear explication of evidence, and instead requires interrogating one’s existing worldview and comparing alternative options for action, as opposed to analyzing energy options in isolation.

The limited research that speaks to ethical considerations largely describes ethical concerns associated with development – extremely few claims in research literature make an ethical case for development. The most common ethical concerns cited in research stem from issues of distributive justice, with procedural justice, the precautionary principle, exposure to involuntary risks, rights-based arguments, and changes in community character and way of life as next most common. Additional research hints implicitly at ethical dilemmas associated with shale gas development, but does not openly identify these issues as having moral implications. Many ethical considerations relate closely to concerns about water quality and the volume/supply of water available for other purposes. The limited scholarship in this area reveals the import of understanding the ways in which ethics permeate thoughts about shale gas development for designing policy that responds to constituent needs and concerns. Even more limited than research on ethical claims in association with shale gas development is well-reasoned scholarship that analyses the extent to which ethical claims about development are well justified and philosophically justifiable.

22,22,"Facts, Fiction, and Perception in Hydraulic Fracturing: Illuminating Act 13 and Robinson Township v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania",2014,"Hydraulic fracturing for oil and natural gas is perhaps the most polarizing energy issue in the United States and around the world, and Pennsylvania has emerged as an example of passionate views both for and against hydraulic fracturing for shale gas. To limit local government restrictions on gas drilling, the Pennsylvania legislature passed Act 13 in September 2012, and the Act largely eliminated the ability of local governments to restrict oil and gas operations through zoning. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court overturned Act 13 in December 2013. This Article reviews how Act 13 came to be, highlights the key provisions of the Act, and explains the various rationales used by the court to overturn the Act. The Article then takes a critical look at the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s reliance on unsupported facts and illustrates how even well-meaning assumptions applied to highly complex issues can cause more harm then good. The Article further argues that the court did not sufficiently analyze the full scope of environmental impacts of Act 13 and the related natural gas output that would accompany it. After the court decided to engage in the environmental analysis (rather than deferring to the legislature on policy matters), a detailed fact-gathering and analysis process was warranted to avoid adopting common misconceptions as legal facts. To be clear, this Article does not argue that the court was wrong to question the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing. Instead, it argues that the court’s decision failed to consider the full host of potential environmental risks related to energy extraction and production, which provide necessary context when considering the proper way to manage the corpus of the public trust and enforce the environmental protections mandated by the Pennsylvania Constitution. The Article cautions that a majority of the court appears to have relied on “fracking distractions,” which are real social or environmental risks that are incorrectly, and inappropriately, linked with hydraulic fracturing. Despite the court’s laudable focus on environmental protection, the Article also argues that the decision could cause unintended problems beyond the natural gas industry, unless future courts read the case narrowly. The Article concludes that a more tailored version of Act 13 may be feasible and that a renewed commitment to determining and analyzing the full complement of pertinent facts related to hydraulic fracturing is warranted and necessary to minimize potential environmental and social harms and to maximize potential benefits.","Facts, Fiction, and Perception in Hydraulic Fracturing: Illuminating Act 13 and Robinson Township v.

To be clear, this Article does not argue that the court was wrong to question the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing. Instead, it argues that the court’s decision failed to consider the full host of potential environmental risks related to energy extraction and production, which provide necessary context when considering the proper way to manage the corpus of the public trust and enforce the environmental protections mandated by the Pennsylvania Constitution. The Article cautions that a majority of the court appears to have relied on “fracking distractions,” which are real social or environmental risks that are incorrectly, and inappropriately, linked with hydraulic fracturing. Despite the court’s laudable focus on environmental protection, the Article also argues that the decision could cause unintended problems beyond the natural gas industry, unless future courts read the case narrowly. The Article concludes that a more tailored version of Act 13 may be feasible and that a renewed commitment to determining and analyzing the full complement of pertinent facts related to hydraulic fracturing is warranted and necessary to minimize potential environmental and social harms and to maximize potential benefits.",414,"['court', 'act', 'act 13', '13', 'pennsylvania', 'article', 'full', 'environmental', 'potential environmental', 'argues', 'hydraulic fracturing', 'fracturing', 'hydraulic', 'fact', 'warranted', 'local government', 'argues court', 'supreme court', 'supreme', 'pennsylvania supreme court']"

Ethics and environmental justice in United Kingdom shale gas policy and planning,2017,"ABSTRACTThe exploitation of shale gas resources is a significant issue of environmental justice. Uneven distributions of risks and social impacts to local site communities must be balanced against the economic benefits to gas users and developers; and unequal decision-making powers must be negotiated between local and central governments, communities and fracking site developers. These distributive and procedural elements are addressed in relation to UK policy, planning, regulatory and industry development. I adopt an explicitly normative framework of policy evaluation, addressing a research gap on the ethics of shale gas by operationalising Shrader-Frechette’s Principle of Prima Facie Political Equality.

We analyse UHD-related metaphorical devices deployed in broadsheet newspapers in Australia, the UK and the USA between January 2006 and May 2018. We develop an innovative Type Hierarchy Approach to metaphors by mapping through directed graph hierarchies. These allow concept-mapping analysis in terms of supertypes and subtypes, i.e. concepts ordered in terms of generality and inclusion as in “rapid expansion” → “explosion”. We find two broad discourses, each containing metaphorical constructions: economic gain across temporal horizons (incorporating boom, bonanza, revolution and death metaphors); and risk tolerance and decision-making (incorporating gamble and insanity metaphors). At the level of individual metaphors, deployment trends and patterns can be mapped along country borders rather than for example political alignment. Boom and bonanza appear most widespread in the USA, whereas UHD as a revolution is more closely associated with UK newspapers. Over time, UHD-related metaphor use decreases in all three countries, potentially reflecting an increasing public acceptance of UHD and moving shale gas from unconventional to conventional hydrocarbon development.","Fracking and metaphor: Analysing newspaper discourse in the USA, Australia and the United Kingdom Abstract We apply a mixed-method design centred on the deployment of metaphors to explore the role that language plays in the structuring of the public discourses of unconventional hydrocarbon development (UHD) across three major developed economies.

Although the UK government and the business community have been very keen to stress the economic benefits associated with the development of these resources, a range of environmental organisations and community groups are vociferously opposed to such development. With this in mind, this research note describes the characteristics of shale oil and hydraulic fracturing, outlines the initial developments within the UK, rehearses some of the principal arguments and claims on the perceived benefits and costs associated with the hydraulic fracturing of gas shale resources and offers a discussion on how the case for and against shale gas development is being made. The discussion suggests that local opposition groups are well organised and have been harnessing information and communication technologies and social media to good effect. Within the shale gas industry, there is a consensus that managing and turning round widespread negative public perceptions about shale gas development will be essential if shale gas resources are to be commercially exploited.

26,26,Fracking bad language : hydraulic fracturing and earthquake risks,2020,"Abstract. Hydraulic fracturing, fracking, is a well stimulation technique used to enhance permeability to aid geological resource management, including the extraction of shale gas. The process of hydraulic fracturing can induce seismicity and the risk of seismicity is a topic of widespread interest and is often reported to be an issue of public concern regarding hydraulic fracturing. This is particularly the case in the UK, where seismicity induced by hydraulic fracturing has halted shale gas operations, and triggered moratoria. However, there seems a disconnect between the level of risk and concern around seismicity caused by shale gas operations as perceived by publics and that reported by expert groups (from industry, policy, and academia), which could manifest in the terminology used to describe the seismic events (tremors, earthquakes, micro-earthquakes). In this paper, we examine the conclusions on induced seismicity and hydraulic fracturing from expert-led public facing reports on shale gas published between 2012 and 2018 and the terminology used in these reports. We compare these to results from studies conducted in the same time period that explore public views on hydraulic fracturing and seismicity. Further, we surveyed participants at professional and public events on shale gas held throughout 2014 to elicit whether they associate shale gas with earthquakes. We use the same question that was used in a series of surveys of the UK publics in the period 2012–2016, but we asked our participants to provide the reasoning for the answer they gave. By examining the rationale provided for their answers we find that an apparent polarisation of views amongst experts is an artefact and in fact responses are confounded by ambiguity of language around earthquake risk, magnitude, and scale. We find that different terms are used to describe earthquakes, often in an attempt to express the magnitude, shaking, or risk presented by the earthquake, but that these terms are poorly defined and ambiguous and do not translate into everyday language usage. Such “fracking bad language” has led to challenges in the perception and communication of risks around earthquakes and hydraulic fracturing, and leaves language susceptible to emotional loading and misinterpretation. We call for multi-method approaches to understand perceived risks around geoenergy resources, and suggest that adopting a shared language framework to describe earthquakes would alleviate miscommunication and misperceptions. This work is relevant for a range of applications where risks are challenging to conceptualise and poorly constrained; particularly those of public interest where language inconsistency can exacerbate communication challenges and can have widespread consequence.","Fracking bad language : hydraulic fracturing and earthquake risks Abstract.

28,28,Framing Effects and Mobilization along the Marcellus Shale,2014,"How do social movements mobilize supporters to their cause? Social movement scholars have emphasized the importance of framing by media, political leaders, social movements, and other actors. While there is extensive research on framing in mass communication and the effect that media frames have on public opinion, there is less research on how framing may affect an individual’s willingness to mobilize for a cause. Some scholars have discussed the resonance of a frame for a target audience (Snow and Benford 1988). Others have argued that “mobilizing potency” may be a good proxy for frame resonance, because it taps into the ability of a social movement to gain supporters for protests, petitions, or other actions (Johnston and Noakes 2005). However, few studies have sought to systematically test the link between frame resonance and mobilization. This study seeks to fill that gap in the literature by testing the relationship between framing effects and mobilization. Using the case of shale gas development along the Marcellus Shale, this study employs both in-the-field interviews and an experiment that assesses how certain frames affect individual perceptions and their willingness to mobilize for a particular social movement. This study fits neatly in the intersection between the political communication and social movement literatures and contributes to both. In particular, it offers a link between framing effects and mobilization for social movement scholars, and further study on the production of frames and frames in competition to build on the political communication literature.","Framing Effects and Mobilization along the Marcellus Shale How do social movements mobilize supporters to their cause?

On 6 October 2016, the central Government over-turned the initial decisions at one site and gave Cuadrilla more time to address traffic concerns at the other. The paper uses the public enquiry to map the contours of the shale gas conflict. It is divided into three sections. The first explores public attitudes towards shale gas development in the UK and reveals growing public awareness and increasing opposition. The second presents the conceptual frame for the analysis, which includes both a critical assessment of the social licence to operate (SLO) and an introduction to a social, actuarial, and political risk and licensing model (SAP Model). The third deploys the SAP model to analyse the public enquiry. The model explains how Cuadrilla is able drill despite the absence of both a local political and social licence to operate. It is concluded that unless the industry and the government can address growing public concerns about shale gas development, continuing conflict could constrain commercial development.","Learning from Lancashire: exploring the contours of the shale gas conflict in England This paper explores the conflict over shale gas exploration in Lancashire where the company Cuadrilla is preparing to horizontally drill and hydraulically fracture the first shale gas wells in England.

33,33,Looking through the prism of shale gas development: Towards a holistic framework for analysis,2016,"Abstract In consideration of the size and geographic concentration of proved conventional gas reserves and the potential role of natural gas to reduce the carbon intensity of energy demand, unconventional gas resources have become increasingly important to expand natural gas supplies. Shale gas in particular has gained international relevance in recent years, largely due to its rapid development and game-changing effects in the United States and its wider and larger distribution worldwide over conventional gas reserves; nonetheless, developing shale gas in other countries has been much slower, as it presents increased risks that span multiple interlinked dimensions and differ across the perceptions of an ample array of stakeholders in diverse contextual settings. The premises presented in this paper attempt to advance a holistic framework for shale gas development which comprises several factors grouped in three major interlinked domains: access to natural resources, industry capabilities and governance. To empirically test its premises under contextual variations, the framework is further used to consistently analyze the cases of Canada, China and Mexico. Findings confirm the interdisciplinary nature of shale gas development and suggest that governance is the most critical domain to bring about changes that improve the management of underlying risks.","Looking through the prism of shale gas development: Towards a holistic framework for analysis Abstract In consideration of the size and geographic concentration of proved conventional gas reserves and the potential role of natural gas to reduce the carbon intensity of energy demand, unconventional gas resources have become increasingly important to expand natural gas supplies.

34,34,New Trends and Challenges for Energy Geographies: Introduction to the Special Issue,2014,"In 1961, the Canadian geographer John D. Chapman recognized the rapid growth in demand for inanimate energy and the role geographers could be playing in explaining its patterns and importance in the growing world economy (Chapman, 1961). Fifty years later, Karl Zimmerer (2011) introduced a Special Issue of the Annals of the Association of American Geographers by noting that not only had Chapman’s prediction come true but that geographers were studying even a wider spectrum of energy challenges than Chapman could ever have imagined (see e.g. Dorian et al., 2006; Florini, Sovaccol, 2009). Many of those energy challenges were underscored at last year’s G20 summit in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Particular attention was paid to four concerns considered as crucial for global energy (OECD, 2013): phasing out fossil fuel subsidies (which encourage wasteful consumption, disproportionately benefit wealthier countries and sectors, and distort energy markets); price volatility (understanding and reducing temporal fluctuations and regional differences in commodity prices); market transparency (a necessity for accurate and timely energy data); and – last but not least – options of mitigating climate change (as the source of two-thirds of global greenhouse-gas emissions, the energy sector is crucial for achieving any climate change goals).By 2035, the world is projected to consume one-third more energy than today, while electricity demand should increase even by more than two-thirds (IEA, 2013). The centre of gravity of global energy demand will move decisively towards emerging economies such as China, India or Brazil, which should account for more than 90% of net energy demand growth. At the same time, however, it is estimated there will still be one billion people without access to electricity and 2.7 billion without access to clean cooking fuels in 2035, mostly in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa (ibid.). The current global energy market is characterized by rising differences in regional energy prices (depending on the availability of domestic resources and regional position within international energy flows), which have led to major shifts in energy and overall trade balances, as well as to energy expenditures taking a growing share of household income (IEA, 2013). The current political crisis in Ukraine and Russia´s chess operations with the supply of natural gas, have again emphasized the role of energy as an effective tool to influence international relations and maintaining political influence.During the last two decades, environmental and security concerns have led to a rapid and far-flung development of renewable energies. Modern wind power development, for example, now is found in over 100 countries, and solar power deployment is – in one form or another – in many more. Reaping the benefits of renewable sources has become a global ambition for several reasons, ranging from anxieties about climate change and energy security to the dangers of the atom. Indeed, the generous feed-in tariffs that Germany used to stimulate renewable energy development have been so effective that Chancellor Merkel was able to renounce Germany’s nuclear program after the Fukushima nuclear accident in 2011 (The Economist, 2011). Nonetheless, renewable energy development has been uneven around the world. Despite rapid and substantial growth in countries such as China, Germany, Spain and the United States, it still represents but a small amount of generation in most countries. For this reason, governments still need to consider other options, including cleaner use of fossil fuels, nuclear power, and new technologies such as shale gas fracking.All energy sources are characterized by potentially negative impacts, direct or indirect, manifesting themselves at different spatio-temporal scales. The economic costs of resources and the reliability of their supply are no longer the only criteria shaping political decisions and public opinions. Rather, perceptions of energy landscapes from renewable energy resources can be significant factors affecting: (1) national energy policies and their support by the general public (Leiserowitz et al., 2013); (2) acceptance of new energy facilities by local communities (Frantal, Kucera, 2009; Frantal, 2014; Pasqualetti, 2011a; Pasqualetti, 2011b; Soland et al., 2013, etc.); and even (3) customer loyalty in liberalized residential energy markets (Hartmann, Ibanez, 2007).The concept of what we call the “energy landscape” is one of the most intriging, important and challenging themes of the new geography of energy. Energy landscape is a term that has been commonly used for decades in physics and organic chemistry. In recent years, however, it has acquired a new meaning in the field of geography and landscape ecology (Pasqualetti, 2012). An energy landscape is a landscape whose images and functions (be they natural, productive, residential, recreational, cultural, etc.) have been significantly affected by energy development. Traditional energy landscapes include mines, canals, refineries and power plants, transmission lines, well fields and waste disposal sites, but more recently they have come to include expansive, whirling wind turbines and even the glare of solar central receivers in places like Ivanpah Dry Lake California (e.g. Nadai, Van der Horst, 2010; Zimmerman, 2014). In the broadest context, the range of what can be called an energy landscape is particularly expansive, though it may be used in the context of all branches of energy production and consumption with a geographic expression.Projects like wind farms, solar power plants, the cultivation of energy crops, biogas stations and other innovative technologies, have become effective means of realizing officially declared state-subsidized support for clean and sustainable energy. These projects, as well, can be objects of entrepreneurial interest among investors and developers, a potential source of income for communities involved (often located in less-favoured rural areas), and an alternative type of land use and source of profit for","New Trends and Challenges for Energy Geographies: Introduction to the Special Issue In 1961, the Canadian geographer John D. Chapman recognized the rapid growth in demand for inanimate energy and the role geographers could be playing in explaining its patterns and importance in the growing world economy (Chapman, 1961).

35,35,NiMbY or Not? integrating social factors into shale Gas Community Engagements,2013,"Shale gas extraction is an issue of significant local and national political controversy. It is widely recognized that engaging the public with both the science of fracking and with local siting processes is important in achieving public acceptance. The siting of shale gas facilities has become subject to both national and local political controversy, most recently in the United Kingdom, where concerns over localized seismic activity close to the northwestern town of Blackpool caused a temporary moratorium on Cuadrilla’s hydraulic fracturing activities and a political rethink of how unconventional gas reserves fit in to broader national energy policy. It is widely recognized that local opposition to hydraulic fracturing is one of the most significant obstacles to the expansion of the fledgling shale gas industry in Europe. This article looks at the social factors involved in not in my back yard (NIMBY) opposition. December 2012’s special issue of Natural Gas & Electricity explored this opposition in relation to community consultation and the NIMBY problem. This article is a response to some of the challenges raised in that special issue, and in particular I aim to flesh out some of the strategies raised in van der Velden and Schildmeijer’s early engagement and transparency approach1 and Severson’s social ecology approach,2 by translating some of the significant social scientific research on NIMBYism and community consultation in relation to wellestablished energy sectors (notably wind and nuclear generation) to the shale gas industry. The aim is to problematize this concept of engaging with “the public” on shale gas and, it is hoped, to help shale gas developers sidestep the pitfalls of ineffective communication practice by informing shale gas developers on how to avoid some of the pitfalls of bad process design.","NiMbY or Not? integrating social factors into shale Gas Community Engagements Shale gas extraction is an issue of significant local and national political controversy.

36,36,"Not under my backyard? Psychological distance, local acceptance, and shale gas development in China",2020,"Abstract Shale gas development can negatively impact those residing in close proximity to projects. Evidence from protests in Europe and the United States suggests a growing prevalence of “NUMBYism” (Not Under My Backyard) sentiment. There is little public discourse about the public acceptance, particularly among those directly affected, of shale gas development in China. Moreover, little research has been done examining whether locally affected publics support or oppose shale gas development, putting policymakers at a disadvantage in terms of risk communication and effective energy governance. Through in-depth interviews with local residents (n = 25) in Weiyuan county that has the largest shale gas reserves in China, the present study extends prior literature on the “NUMBY” phenomenon by exploring local residents’ attitudes toward shale gas development, both locally and distantly. Here we find approximately 20% of our interviewees express views that are consistent with NUMBYism – oppose local development but support or are indifferent to development elsewhere. The rest express views that are fully supportive (52%) or opposed (8%) regardless of local or distant development, or indifferent to local development but either supportive or indifferent to development elsewhere (20%). We find interrelated factors such as national identity – not observed in previous studies – playing an important role in how residents view development. Moreover, drawing upon construal level theory, we also examine the role that different dimensions of psychological distance (e.g., social, temporal, uncertainty, and experiential) may play in explaining these views. These findings may inform policy design and risk communication about shale gas development in China.","Not under my backyard?

37,37,Oil and Gas Consultation and shale gas development in British Columbia,2014,"As northeast British Columbia (BC) undergoes rapid change with the development of a globally competitive shale gas industry, the provincial government has a duty to consult First Nations on any developments that have the potential to infringe on their Aboriginal and treaty rights. This research investigates how the oil and gas consultation process is addressing, and might be improved to better address, Treaty 8 First Nations’ concerns regarding shale gas development within their traditional territories. Interviews were conducted with four Treaty 8 First Nations, the Treaty 8 Tribal Association, oil and gas companies, and representatives of the government of BC. In addition, participant observation was conducted with the Fort Nelson First Nation Lands Department during the summer of 2012. Research indicates that there are two overarching problems with the consultation process: the permit-by-permit approach, and the exclusion of First Nations from the decision-making process. In the absence of adequate provincial environmental regulation, lands departments are working to fill the governance gap, but lack the authority and capacity to do so. We conclude that resolving emerging conflict over the BC shale gas industry will require a restructuring of the governance system that includes early engagement, long-term planning, and cumulative impact assessment and monitoring, as well as meaningful engagement with First Nations in the decision-making process.","Oil and Gas Consultation and shale gas development in British Columbia As northeast British Columbia (BC) undergoes rapid change with the development of a globally competitive shale gas industry, the provincial government has a duty to consult First Nations on any developments that have the potential to infringe on their Aboriginal and treaty rights.

39,39,On the complexity of ethical claims related to shale gas policy,2017,"In a recent article in Local Environment, Matthew Cotton (2017) lays out a foundation for what an ethical approach to decision making on policy and planning in relation to shale gas development could look like. This is the most comprehensive attempt in peer-reviewed academic literature to characterise and explicate the requirements and constraints on ethically-justified policy in relation to this contentious extractive industry. Cotton (2017) uses Shrader-Frechette’s (2002) Principle of Prima Facie Political Equality (PPFPE) to critique policy and planning decisions in the UK in relation to shale gas development. The PPFPE focuses heavily on distributive and procedural justice and gives particular attention to the need for: equitable compensation for any harms sustained, access to information about potential harms, and ability to participate freely in decision making processes (Cotton 2017). Cotton’s (2017) articulation of an ethical framework by which to evaluate the fairness and appropriateness of policy on shale gas development is a major step in the right direction. Evensen (2015, 2016a) has asserted that an explicit account of the circumstances under which development would or would not be ethically justified is perhaps the biggest gap in the policy discourse and debates on this issue. Indeed, there have been numerous public claims about the ethicality of ‘fracking’ (shale gas development), but until Cotton’s (2017) foray into this area, the academic literature on the topic was quite limited (Evensen 2016a). A few prior articles had highlighted distributive justice issues related to fracking (Cotton 2013, Evensen 2015, Fry et al. 2015, Hardy and Kelsey 2015, Hays and de Melo-Martin 2014, Hotaling 2013, Malin 2014, Measham et al. 2016, Willow and Wylie 2014), procedural justice considerations (Cotton 2013, de Wit 2011, Evensen 2015, Finkel et al. 2013, Fry et al. 2015), and/or the role of precautionary thinking in ethical approaches to evaluating unconventional gas development (de Melo-Martin et al. 2015, Finkel and Hays 2013, Law et al. 2014). Cotton’s (2016) article draws together the range of distributive and procedural justice considerations; as such, it is one of the most important social scientific or humanistic articles written to date on this much-debated form of energy development. It offers a solid point of departure for ethical thought on shale gas policy; nevertheless, there is more work to be done. Following Cotton’s analysis, aspects of the PPFPE arise as problematic or require additional clarification, including: the role of compensation in distributive justice, the definition of a ‘community’, the need for information provision, and the best way to ensure procedural justice. Two overarching issues that merit attention in relation to ethical thought on shale gas policy, but that were not addressed by Cotton (2016), are: (1) the role of shale gas development as just one means of energy extraction in a larger energy system – development does not occur in a vacuum – and (2) the role of virtue in determining ethicality of shale gas policies. I speak to these two issues and the four areas of Cotton’s argumentation requiring additional attention below.","On the complexity of ethical claims related to shale gas policy In a recent article in Local Environment, Matthew Cotton (2017) lays out a foundation for what an ethical approach to decision making on policy and planning in relation to shale gas development could look like.

Whether we are talking about undertaking the refurbishment of the Gentilly-2 nuclear power plant, developing the shale gas industry, building a new bridge, retirement income, obesity, access to health services, some of these projects or issues are of concern to the people of Quebec. This book presents the results of an unpublished survey of a representative sample of the Quebec population. The CIRANO 2012 Barometer provides answers to the questions asked by all major project managers: - What is on the minds of Quebeckers today? - What are the projects and issues perceived as the most risky? - What is the level of trust placed by the population in the government for its management of 30 specific projects and issues? - What are the sources of information most used by the population? - How would the population react to the announcement, for example, of the construction of a new nuclear power plant?

Whether we are talking about undertaking the refurbishment of the Gentilly-2 nuclear power plant, developing the shale gas industry, building a new bridge, retirement income, obesity, access to health services, some of these projects or issues are of concern to the people of Quebec. This book presents the results of an unpublished survey of a representative sample of the Quebec population. The CIRANO 2012 Barometer provides answers to the questions asked by all major project managers: - What is on the minds of Quebeckers today? - What are the projects and issues perceived as the most risky? - What is the level of trust placed by the population in the government for its management of 30 specific projects and issues? - What are the sources of information most used by the population? - How would the population react to the announcement, for example, of the construction of a new nuclear power plant?

43,43,Perception of the Natural Gas Industry and Engagement in Individual Civic Actions,2013,"ABSTRACTData collected in a general population survey from a random sample of individuals in Tarrant County, Texas, were used to empirically examine issues associated with public perception of the natural gas industry. Further, the associations of public perception of the energy industry with individual actions that (a) may or may not have been taken and/or (b) may or may not be taken in response to the exploration and production of natural gas were investigated. Echoing findings from research in two neighboring Barnett Shale counties (Theodori 2009), members of the public in Tarrant County appear to dislike certain potentially problematic social and/or environmental issues perceived to accompany natural gas development. Conversely, these same Tarrant County residents view less negatively the economic and/or service-related benefits that often result from such development. Moreover, the results of this study suggest that the social/environmental perceptual variable is a key factor in explaining past behaviors and predicting future behaviors taken in response to the exploration and production of natural gas. Possible implications of these findings are proposed.An extensive rural sociological literature exists on the social, economic, and social-psychological consequences-both positive and negative-associated with energy development (Jacquet 2009). The data for many of these studies were collected in the ""boomtowns"" of the intermountain West or in communities in the coastal region of Louisiana. Over the past five years, a new body of empirical research on energy development has begun to accrue in the rural sociological literature. These studies have focused on the experiences and perceptions of various stakeholders-including, but not limited to, community leaders, landowner coalition leaders, and members of the public-with respect to shale gas development (e.g., Anderson and Theodori 2009; Brasier et al. 2011; Jacquet and Stedman 2011; Schafft, Borlu, and Glenna 2013; Theodori 2009, 2012; Wynveen 2011).Shale gas development is a controversial form of energy development (Marsa 2011; Walsh 2011). At the center of the shale gas debate is the well stimulation/completion process known as hydraulic fracturing (Finkel and Law 2011; Rahm 2011). Shale gas development relies heavily on multistage hydraulic fracturing stimulation to maximize commercial viability. Wells are hydraulically fractured by flushing large quantities of ""frac fluid""-a mixture of freshwater, proppants, and small amounts of friction reducers and other chemicals-into them at extremely high pressure levels to create small cracks, or ""fractures,"" in the shale formations. Doing this allows natural gas to flow more freely through the reservoir and, in turn, increases recovery. Frac jobs commonly use 1 to 3 million gallons of water per gas well; in some cases, water use may exceed 5 million gallons per frac (Anderson and Theodori 2009). Numerous concerns have been raised over the amount of freshwater used by gas producers in the hydraulic fracturing process (Capozza 2009; Theodori 2009). Furthermore, fears continue to escalate over the potential contamination of surface waters and freshwater aquifers from the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process (Olmstead et al. 2013; Osborn et al. 2011).Despite this growing rural sociological literature consisting of contemporary attitudinal studies on shale gas development, surprisingly little research has been conducted on the individual actions that (a) may or may not have been taken and/or (b) may or may not be taken in response to the production of shale gas. The purpose of this research note is to extend the current scientific literature on the social issues associated with unconventional natural gas development (c.f., Theodori 2011).

Both France and Algeria have large unconventional shale deposits—France has the second largest shale gas deposits in Europe after Poland and Algeria has the third largest in the world.

Under what conditions does the public interpret particular scientific knowledge claims as being trustworthy and credible? Using data collected from an online survey experiment, administered to 1,507 adult residents of Quebec, this paper seeks answers to these questions. Specifically, we examine variation in the way members of the public perceive the credibility of scientific experts in the areas of climate change, shale gas extraction, cell phones, and wind farms. Our results contribute to the existing literatures on public perceptions of policy experts, framing, and cultural theory. We find that individuals evaluate expert credibility based on the way in which experts frame issues, and on the congruity/dissonance between these expert communication frames and one's underlying worldview. However, we also identify limits to these framing effects. Our findings shed light on the interaction of framing and political worldviews in shaping public perceptions of expert credibility in various policymaking contexts.","Public Perceptions of Expert Credibility on Policy Issues: The Role of Expert Framing and Political Worldviews How do individuals assess the credibility of experts in various policy domains?

Understanding public perceptions is important given the role that they may play in future policy decisions in both North America and other parts of the world where shale development is at a much earlier stage. We review 58 articles pertaining to perceptions, published between 2009 and 2015. Studies report mixed levels of awareness of shale operations, tending toward higher awareness in areas with existing development. While individuals tend to have negative associations with the term ‘fracking,’ views on shale development are mixed as to whether benefits outweigh risks or vice versa: perceived benefits tend to be economic (e.g., job creation and boosts to local economies) and risks more commonly environmental and/or social (e.g., impacts on water and increased traffic). Some papers point to ethical issues (e.g., inequitable risk/benefit distribution and procedural justice) and widespread distrust of responsible parties, stemming from perceived unfairness, heavy-handed corporate tactics, and lack of transparency. These findings point to the contested, political character of much of the debate about hydraulic fracturing, and raise questions of what constitutes ‘acceptable’ risk in this context. We compare these results with research emerging in the UK over the same period.

We find that individuals’ support for shale gas development is much lower when using the term ‘fracking’ as opposed to the synonymous descriptive term, and moreover, these differences were substantive. Our analysis suggests that these differences appear to be largely the result of different assessments of the risks associated with ‘fracking’ as opposed to ‘using hydraulic pressure to extract natural gas from the ground’. Our proposed explanation for these differences rests on the idea that shale gas development is a technical and complex process and many individuals will be bounded by the rationality of scientific knowledge when it comes to understanding this process. In turn, individuals may be relying on simple decision heuristics shaped by the way this issue is framed by the media and other interested parties which may constrain meaningful discourse on this topic with the public. Our findings also highlight some of the potential pitfalls when it comes to relying on survey research for assessing the public’s views towards complex environmental issues.","Public perceptions of shale gas in the UK: framing effects and decision heuristics Using two equivalent descriptions of the shale gas development process, we asked individuals to indicate their levels of support as well as their perceptions of the risks and costs involved.

The main goal of the M4ShaleGas project is to study and evaluate potential risks and impacts of shale gas exploration and exploitation. The focus lies on four main areas of potential impact: the subsurface, the surface, the atmosphere, and social impacts. The European Commission's Energy Roadmap 2050 identifies gas as a critical fuel for the transformation of the energy system in the direction of lower CO2 emissions and more renewable energy. Shale gas may contribute to this transformation. Shale gas is – by definition – a natural gas found trapped in shale, a fine grained sedimentary rock composed of mud. There are several concerns related to shale gas exploration and production, many of them being associated with hydraulic fracturing operations that are performed to stimulate gas flow in the shales. Potential risks and concerns include for example the fate of chemical compounds in the used hydraulic fracturing and drilling fluids and their potential impact on shallow ground water. The fracturing process may also induce small magnitude earthquakes. There is also an ongoing debate on greenhouse gas emissions of shale gas (CO2 and methane) and its energy efficiency compared to other energy sources There is a strong need for a better European knowledge base on shale gas operations and their environmental impacts particularly, if shale gas shall play a role in Europe’s energy mix in the coming decennia. M4ShaleGas’ main goal is to build such a knowledge base, including an inventory of best practices that minimise risks and impacts of shale gas exploration and production in Europe, as well as best practices for public engagement.

54,54,Resilient but not sustainable? Public perceptions of shale gas development via hydraulic fracturing,2017,"Complex energy development, such as associated with extraction and processing of shale gas, may affect the future sustainability and resilience of the small, often rural communities where development occurs. A difficulty for understanding the connection between sustainability, resilience, and shale gas development (hereafter “SGD”) is that definitions of sustainability and resilience are often muddled and unclear. Nevertheless, the ways in which development could affect sustainability and resilience have been discussed and contested in academic literature. Little is known, however, about the general public’s thoughts on how SGD relates to sustainability and resilience. Despite the overlap and conflation of these two concepts, research indicates some differences between characterizations of the two. While acknowledging difficulties in defining the terms, we included questions on a few broad attributes of the two concepts in a survey (n=1202) of a random sample of residents in the Marcellus Shale region of NY and PA, to explore the relationship between support for / opposition to SGD and perceived importance of community sustainability and resilience. Our survey revealed that beliefs about the importance of sustainability, as measured by three items that clearly pool together as a single factor, are associated with opposition to SGD; beliefs about the importance of resilience, measured by four clearly-connected items, are associated with support for SGD. This finding is particularly intriguing and relevant for communication and policy about sustainability and resilience in connection with energy development, because of the common conflation of the two terms.","Resilient but not sustainable?

55,55,Responsible Shale Gas Productions: Moral Outrage vs. Cool Analysis,2013,"The relatively sudden boom in shale gas production in the United States using hydraulic fracturing has provoked increasingly intense political conflict. The debate over fracking and shale gas production has become polarized very quickly, in part because of the size of the economic and environmental stakes. This polarized debate fits a familiar template in American environmental law, pitting “cool analysis” against “moral outrage.” Opponents of fracking have generally framed their arguments in moral or ethical terms, while systematic research is beginning to build a more careful and nuanced understanding of the risks associated with shale gas production (though the record is far from complete). All of which makes the question of how to produce shale gas “responsibly” – corporate social responsibility being the focus of this symposium – very difficult to answer. This essay argues that: (i) because shale gas production entails difficult to measure and unevenly distributed costs and benefits, there is no clear responsible (read: ethically preferable) set of limitations that we ought to impose on shale gas production; and (ii) moral outrage is obscuring (or influencing perceptions of) empirical facts in the shale gas policy debate. More specifically, well-established behavioral heuristics – particularly, confirmation biases and the cultural cognition of risk – are impeding the development of a common understanding of the empirical facts necessary to guide policymaking. Recognizing this, policymakers must resist political pressures and work that much harder to ground their decisions in empirically-demonstrated facts – namely, those produced by sources that are less susceptible to these heuristics and biases. Thus, information generated by rigorous, empirical analyses performed by academic or government sources ought to be credited over anecdotes or studies associated with industry or NGOs that have staked out a clear pro or con position in the fracking debate. Indeed, responsible fracking decisions ought to consider all of the consequences of permitting, regulating or banning shale gas production, including the relative risks of shale gas production compared with the relevant energy alternatives.","Responsible Shale Gas Productions: Moral Outrage vs. Cool Analysis The relatively sudden boom in shale gas production in the United States using hydraulic fracturing has provoked increasingly intense political conflict.

58,58,Self-Reported Familiarity of Hydraulic Fracturing and Support for Natural Gas Drilling: Substantive and Methodological Considerations,2016,"Rapid development of the US natural gas industry over the last decade has been fueled primarily by technological advances in horizontal drilling and high-volume, multistage hydraulic fracturing (IEA 2012). Hydraulic fracturing - an industrial process frequently called fracking, fracing, or frac'ing - involves flushing large volumes of frac fluid (i.e., a mixture of water and proppant, along with small volumes of friction reducers, disinfectants, and other chemicals) into wells at extremely high pressure levels to create and/or magnify small fissures, or fractures, in the shale formations (King 2012; Theodori et al. 2014). The fracturing of shale gas formations increases recovery by enabling higher permeability through the reservoirs to the wellbores (King 2012).Of late, the topic of hydraulic fracturing has increasingly dominated public discourse and popular press writings (Dobb 2103; Marsa 2011; Walsh 2011). Environmental, social, and behavioral scientists have also begun studying various environmental/natural resource, social, and public health issues associated with increased hydraulic fracturing and shale gas and oil development (Colborn et al. 2011; Olmstead et al. 2013; Shonkoff, Hays, and Finkel 2014; Weber, Geigle, and Barkdull 2014). Citing both perceived and objective environmental and health concerns, lawmakers in municipalities across the country - and recently at a state level (New York) - have passed legislation banning the process of high-volume, multistage hydraulic fracturing within their jurisdictions.The purpose of this paper is to add to the sociological literature on issues associated with hydraulic fracturing. Recent studies have sought information on American's views of hydraulic fracturing from national samples of residents (Boudet et al. 2014; Davis and Fisk 2014) but do not focus on the views of residents living in areas such as Pennsylvania that are most affected by the rapid development of the natural gas industry. Other studies provide information on the views of selected stakeholder groups and community and/or key informants (Brasier et al. 2011; Ceresola and Crowe 2015; Ladd 2013; Schafft et al. 2014) rather than assessing residents' views directly. A 2009 survey of Pennsylvania residents in the Marcellus Region provided early baseline information about residents' perceptions (Alter et al. 2010), and a subsequent study (Willits, Luloff, and Theodori 2013a) documented changes in residents' views in the intervening years. The current analysis drew upon the latter survey data to assess residents' self-reported familiarity with hydraulic fracturing and its association with support or opposition to the development of natural gas. Specifically, the following research questions were addressed:Research Question 1: To what extent do residents report they are familiar with hydraulic fracturing and how does reported familiarity differ depending upon the individuals' sociodemographic characteristics, primary sources of information, density of well development in their counties, and the mode of data collection?Research Question 2: How does perceived familiarity with hydraulic fracturing relate to residents' support or opposition to development of the natural gas industry in their area?DATAIn 2012, random samples of persons living in 21 counties in the Marcellus Shale region in Pennsylvania were contacted and asked to participate in a survey concerning their opinions about natural gas development. All counties were located in the central core or tier one areas of the Marcellus region as defined by geologists at the time (Dell et al. 2008), and all had experienced at least some Marcellus Shale drilling activity. However, the well densities of the areas varied widely. Twelve of the counties contained between 1 and 128 wells in 2012, with 12 or fewer wells per 100 square miles of land area.

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can increase through sexual mixing patterns associated with labor migration. No prior studies have quantified the relationship between shale gas activity and rates of three reportable STIs: chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis. Methods We conducted a longitudinal, ecologic study from 2000–2016 in Ohio, situated in a prolific shale gas region in the United States (US). Data on reported cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis by county and year were obtained from the Ohio Department of Health. All 88 counties were classified as none, low, and high shale gas activity in each year, using data from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. Annual rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated from mixed-effects Poisson regression models evaluating the relationship between shale gas activity and reported annual STI rates while adjusting for secular trends and potential confounders obtained from the US Census. Results Compared to counties with no shale gas activity, counties with high activity had 21% (RR = 1.21; 95%CI = 1.08–1.36) increased rates of chlamydia and 19% (RR = 1.27; 95%CI 0.98–1.44) increased rates of gonorrhea, respectively. No association was observed for syphilis. Conclusion This first report of a link between shale gas activity and increased rates of both chlamydia and gonorrhea may inform local policies and community health efforts.","Shale gas activity and increased rates of sexually transmitted infections in Ohio, 2000-2016.

Annual rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated from mixed-effects Poisson regression models evaluating the relationship between shale gas activity and reported annual STI rates while adjusting for secular trends and potential confounders obtained from the US Census. Results Compared to counties with no shale gas activity, counties with high activity had 21% (RR = 1.21; 95%CI = 1.08–1.36) increased rates of chlamydia and 19% (RR = 1.27; 95%CI 0.98–1.44) increased rates of gonorrhea, respectively. No association was observed for syphilis.

61,61,Shale Gas and Hydraulic Fracturing in the Great Lakes Region: Current Issues and Public Opinion,2014,"This report presents the views of people living within the Great Lakes Basin regarding hydraulic fracturing and shale gas drilling. Hydraulic fracturing, the injection of a fluid after drilling to crack open shale rock to release oil or gas, has been used by industry for decades. However, recent breakthroughs in horizontal drilling techniques combined with hydraulic fracturing, have enabled oil and gas recovery from “unconventional” oil and gas reserves, previously considered inaccessible. This process is commonly known as “fracking,” which can refer to just the hydraulic fracturing process itself or the entire drilling process.As the developments in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling technology have produced an increase in oil and gas supplies, many states in the US and provinces in Canada are trying to determine how to leverage the associated economic potential. In response to this rapid change in the energy landscape and the potential future energy portfolios of the US and Canada, this report serves to provide background on shale developments within the Great Lakes Region — Ontario, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin — as well as a preliminary assessment of public opinion of fracking from residents within the Great Lakes Basin.This survey was part of a larger public opinion survey, which also assessed public views from the Great Lakes Region about environmental issues and policy in the Region as well as a closer look at policy related to wind power. These reports have been published by the Center for Local, State, and Urban Policy and are publicly available, among others, on related facets of this topic.","Shale Gas and Hydraulic Fracturing in the Great Lakes Region: Current Issues and Public Opinion This report presents the views of people living within the Great Lakes Basin regarding hydraulic fracturing and shale gas drilling.

62,62,Shale Gas Development and Community Distress: Evidence from England.,2020,"This research examines psychosocial stress associated with shale gas development through the narratives of residents and the Revised Impact of Event Scale (IES-R). We carried out our research in three of England’s communities impacted by shale gas development. To gather data, we conducted qualitative interviews and engaged in participant observation in all three communities and conducted a quantitative survey of residents. From our qualitative interviews it was apparent that the residents we spoke with experienced significant levels of stress associated with shale gas development in each community. Importantly, residents reported that stress was not only a reaction to development, but a consequence of interacting with industry and decision makers. Our quantitative findings suggest that a significant portion of residents 14.1% living near the shale gas sites reported high levels of stress (i.e., scoring 24 or more points) even while the mean IES-R score of residents living around the site is relatively low (i.e., 9.6; 95% CI 7.5–11.7). We conclude that the experiences, of the three English communities, reported in the qualitative interviews and quantitative survey are consistent with the reports of stress in the United States for those residents who live in shale gas communities. We therefore suggest that psychosocial stress is an important negative externality, which needs to be taken seriously by local planning officers and local planning committees when considering exploration and development permits for shale gas.","Shale Gas Development and Community Distress: Evidence from England.

64,64,Shale gas development in the Great Karoo : the potential socio-economic impacts on the town of Beaufort-West,2012,"With the advent of shale gas exploration in the Karoo region, the purpose of this study was to investigate the possible socio-economic impacts of shale gas development on the town of Beaufort West in the Karoo. A qualitative study method was used to establish possible socio economic impacts by reviewing literature with regard to existing shale gas development as well as a case study from the United States of America (USA). A desktop study of Beaufort West was carried out to establish current socio economic trends in the town. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with key stakeholders to establish their concerns and opinion regarding the possibility of shale gas exploration and production in the area of Beaufort West in the Karoo. The results of the study concluded that the concerns of the key stakeholders were definitely relevant as their livelihood would be threatened if there was any possibility of contamination of their water sources. Other possible socio economic impacts included infrastructure concerns with regard to road maintenance, tourism declining and the threat of noise and air pollution. The study recommends that if the shale gas development process were to go ahead, the South African government would need to ensure that best practices are incorporated by all gas drilling companies. A team of qualified and trained regulators should monitor well pads and hydraulic fracturing methods as well as volumes of water used and the disposal of waste water. The regulations existing in the country should be revised to incorporate the stringent standards of other countries that have strict monitoring policies in place. In order to protect the people of the Karoo and the heritage of South Africa, the government must ensure that gas companies are held liable for any kind of environmental or socio economic impact.","Shale gas development in the Great Karoo : the potential socio-economic impacts on the town of Beaufort-West With the advent of shale gas exploration in the Karoo region, the purpose of this study was to investigate the possible socio-economic impacts of shale gas development on the town of Beaufort West in the Karoo.

65,65,Shale Gas Extraction in North Carolina: Research Recommendations and Public Health Implications,2013,"North Carolina has no history of large-scale commercial oil and gas extraction, and the state’s legislative framework for regulating drilling was, until recently, based on laws passed in the 1940s. However, areas of the state are likely to undergo horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing for natural gas and oil in the near future. North Carolina thus has a unique opportunity to produce a legislative framework that a) incorporates experiences from other states, b) includes state-of-the-art technologies and best practices, and c) protects the health of North Carolina’s citizens and ecosystems. Knowledge of the health risks associated with hydraulic fracturing is sparse. Some of the chemicals that can be used in the hydraulic fracturing process are toxic (Bamberger and Oswald 2012; Colborn et al. 2011). However, the concentrations of these chemicals used at a given well site are not disclosed in most states; thus, evaluating the risk of exposure and associated health impacts is difficult. Residents living < 1 km from hydraulically fractured wells are potentially at greater risk for health effects from natural gas development, which in some cases may include exposure to trimethylbenzenes, xylenes, and aliphatic hydrocarbons in air (McKenzie et al. 2012). These residents can also, but do not always, have higher concentrations of dissolved methane and other gases in their drinking water (Jackson et al. 2013; Osborn et al. 2011; Warner et al. 2013). In October 2012, the Research Triangle Environmental Health Collaborative convened a summit of experts from the oil and gas industry, nonprofit organizations, government agencies, and academia to consider the potential impacts of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing in North Carolina. The summit included three working groups that focused on potential outcomes related to hydraulic fracturing: exposure pathways, health impacts, and social impacts. The summit recommended actions and policies to safeguard the health of North Carolina’s citizens and environment if hydraulic fracturing occurs in the state (Research Triangle Environmental Health Collaborative 2013). The recommendations should also be useful for policy makers in other states. Summit participants discussed numerous recommendations, with three categories having the broadest support. First, the participants noted the importance of collecting comprehensive background data on air quality, water quality, and human and ecosystem health before oil or gas drilling occurs. Such data provide a baseline documenting current conditions that can be used to determine whether changes take place in the future, thus protecting both citizens and drilling companies from unfounded claims of damages. The quality and quantity of ground and surface water resources potentially affected by drilling should be studied, including analyses of major ions, trace metals, dissolved gases such as methane, radioactivity, and a range of organic compounds. Hydrocarbons from oil and gas wells should be characterized based on chemical and isotopic composition, which aids wastewater treatment and makes it easier to identify potential contamination if hydrocarbons are released into the environment. Ambient air monitoring of potential drilling areas should be performed because emissions from drilling sites may contain volatile organic compounds, particulates, and other contaminants. Ecosystem health, such as the identity and abundance of stream organisms, in the areas near drilling should also be assessed. Second, participants supported a comprehensive health impact assessment (HIA) as a means to monitor and avoid potential health problems in the future. An HIA should combine local-, regional-, and state-level medical and demographic data. Tracking of any health problems encountered in other states with hydraulic fracturing could provide early warning of heath problems that might occur in North Carolina and allow preventative action. Psychological and other stressors beyond direct chemical exposure should be considered, including sources such as increased road traffic and light and noise pollution. The HIA should also examine the potential economic costs associated with health impacts, including, for example, potential water remediation or increased rates of asthma. The third broad recommendation was to create a community needs and assets assessment (CNAA) to address potential social impacts. The CNAA should a) identify what jobs will be available to local workers, b) develop citizen stakeholder forums and reporting mechanisms, c) update transportation planning and safety training, and d) implement strong consumer protections. The working group on social impacts also recommended creating an ombudsman to facilitate communication between stakeholders and industry. For all three of these recommendations as well as for the many others included in the report (Research Triangle Environmental Health Collaborative 2013), it is important to clarify who is responsible for collecting such data and how to pay for it. One mechanism to ensure access for background data collection is to make gas well permits contingent on temporary site access for ambient air and water monitoring before, during, and after drilling and hydraulic fracturing. Policy makers might consider a bonding and remediation program to provide adequate cleanup, remediation, and maintenance funds. The cost of performing comprehensive environmental or health remediation should be considered in assessing bonding fees. Finally, it is important to decide—before drilling begins—how increased costs of infrastructure maintenance and staff will be apportioned. North Carolina has the opportunity to develop model programs and best-management practices for shale gas drilling and hydraulic fracturing. Our recommendations complement the work of North Carolina’s Mining and Energy Commission and can help North Carolina and other states protect the public’s health in areas undergoing unconventional oil and gas production.","Shale Gas Extraction in North Carolina: Research Recommendations and Public Health Implications North Carolina has no history of large-scale commercial oil and gas extraction, and the state’s legislative framework for regulating drilling was, until recently, based on laws passed in the 1940s.

70,70,"Social impacts of earthquakes caused by gas extraction in the Province of Groningen, The Netherlands",2015,"Abstract Gas extraction from the Groningen gasfield in the northern Netherlands has led to localised earthquakes which are projected to become more severe. The social impacts experienced by local residents include: damage to property; declining house prices; concerns about the chance of dykes breaking; feelings of anxiety and insecurity; health issues; and anger. These social and emotional impacts are exacerbated by the increasing distrust Groningen people have towards the national government and the gas company, NAM, a partnership between Shell and ExxonMobil. The earthquakes have reopened discussions about the distribution of benefits from gas production and the extent to which benefits are retained locally. Mitigation of the impacts is attempted, but the lack of trust decreases the effectiveness of the mitigation measures.

The social impacts experienced by local residents include: damage to property; declining house prices; concerns about the chance of dykes breaking; feelings of anxiety and insecurity; health issues; and anger. These social and emotional impacts are exacerbated by the increasing distrust Groningen people have towards the national government and the gas company, NAM, a partnership between Shell and ExxonMobil. The earthquakes have reopened discussions about the distribution of benefits from gas production and the extent to which benefits are retained locally. Mitigation of the impacts is attempted, but the lack of trust decreases the effectiveness of the mitigation measures.

71,71,Social sustainability assessment of shale gas in the UK,2018,"Abstract The majority of shale gas studies so far have focused on environmental impacts with few considering societal aspects. This paper presents a first and most comprehensive assessment of the social impacts of shale gas production and utilisation for electricity generation, focusing on the UK context. The assessment has been carried out based on 14 indicators, addressing the following social sustainability issues: employment, health and safety, nuisance, public perceptions, local communities, infrastructure and resources. Shale gas is compared to a range of other electricity options, including other fossil fuels, nuclear and renewables. Where appropriate and possible, the social impacts are evaluated on a life cycle basis. The results suggest that extraction and utilisation of shale gas would lead to a range of benefits, including employment opportunities and financial gains by local communities. However, these are limited and countered by a number of social barriers that need to be overcome, including low public support, noise, traffic, strain on infrastructure (e.g. wastewater treatment facilities), land use conflict and availability of regulatory resources. Furthermore, shale gas does not present a notable opportunity for increasing energy security, unless its production increases significantly above current predictions. These findings can be used by policy makers, operators and other shale gas stakeholders with an interest in the social impacts of shale gas development. The results can also be useful for other countries planning to exploit their shale gas reserves.","Social sustainability assessment of shale gas in the UK Abstract The majority of shale gas studies so far have focused on environmental impacts with few considering societal aspects.

72,72,Stacked scale frames: building hegemony for fracking across scales,2015,"This paper introduces the concept of stacked scale frames and explains how they can legitimate a particular set of interests as general interests. Specifically, it examines how shale gas development proceeded in Pennsylvania, and finds that stacked scale frames were a tool for establishing the legitimacy of fracking. Fracking is a technique for extracting oil and natural gas from shale rock formations using highly pressurised water, sand and chemicals. It has produced dramatic amounts of gas and wealth over the past seven to eight years, but poses risks to the environment and public health that are largely understudied and misunderstood. Previous studies of fracking have explained the rise of fracking in Pennsylvania using analyses of advertisements and corporate promotional materials. This study builds on their work and adds an understanding of the fracking boom seen through the concept of hegemony. The data used in this paper draw from a set of interviews with ‘intellectuals’ in Gramsci's sense of the word: societal elites who mould and shape public opinion. In the case of fracking, these elites included representatives of oil and gas capital, the state, academia, NGOs and civil society living near fracking sites. Overall, the benefits of fracking were recognised by all groups and the costs were less commonly represented. This paper contributes the concept of stacked scale frames to literature on social production of scale in human geography. Stacked scale frames made capitalist economic development appear to benefit a wider section of society spread across multiple scales simultaneously. In contrast, opponents of fracking framed the costs of fracking at individual scales and in a piecemeal fashion. It concludes that anti-fracking forces, and political ecologists in general, should embrace a critique that draws together social and environmental harms across multiple scales simultaneously.","Stacked scale frames: building hegemony for fracking across scales This paper introduces the concept of stacked scale frames and explains how they can legitimate a particular set of interests as general interests.

73,73,Stakeholder Concerns Against Shale Gas Developments in Europe - The Relevance of Water Management,2014,"The exploration of shale gas resources in Europe is moving at a slow pace, despite the fact that drilling for reservoir characterization is essential for any further planning. Whether shale gas development in certain regions is economically feasible at all and what such development activities might entail can’t be determined in the absence of critical data. Yet, there is widespread public resistance that influences political decision making and permitting, and that sometimes doesn’t even allow for exploration. Most of the stakeholders concerns are related to perceived environmental risks for water resources as a result of hydraulic fracturing. The main themes are concerns about the contamination of water bodies by fracturing chemicals, methane or flowback water, or concerns about the depletion of groundwater and surface water. While some of those perceived risks may be overestimated or unsubstantiated, there are real risks that have to be addressed by thorough assessments of the environmental, health and social impacts, and by an integrated approach to water management from sourcing to final disposal. This includes the transportation and distribution logistics for water and wastewater movements. It is essential to establish relevant reference and baseline data on groundwater and surface water systems well ahead of project implementation, to assess risks in a fashion that is understood by interested stakeholders, to define proactive and reactive resource protection measures, and to monitor performance. This paper suggests an integrated approach to water management that combines the elements of impact assessments, scientific and technical data gathering, and the monitoring of potential impacts across the life cycle of a shale gas project, as well as sourcing, transportation and disposal strategies. All results and measures taken need to be communicated and documented in a clear and transparent manner.","Stakeholder Concerns Against Shale Gas Developments in Europe - The Relevance of Water Management The exploration of shale gas resources in Europe is moving at a slow pace, despite the fact that drilling for reservoir characterization is essential for any further planning.

74,74,Summit Discusses Public Health Implications of Fracking,2013,"In the wake of the North Carolina state legislature’s July 2012 vote to legalize new oil and gas exploration,1 the state is poised to join the ranks of others already tapping into shale gas deposits with the help of hydraulic fracturing (fracking). But public and environmental health concerns, particularly those related to air emissions2 and drinking water safety and security,3,4,5 have sparked controversy in states such as Pennsylvania, where fracking is already being used to extract natural gas. At the fifth annual summit of the Research Triangle Environmental Health Collaborative, based in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, stakeholders worked in three breakout groups over two days to recommend best practices for policy makers, the fracking industry, and community members in this and other states.6 In summer 2012 the U.S. Geological Survey released an assessment of undiscovered oil and gas resources in North Carolina,7 which state geologist Kenneth Taylor says equals about five years’ current consumption for the state. Gas extraction in North Carolina’s Sanford sub-basin—the most promising area for drilling—has been projected to provide an average of 387 jobs per year over seven years.8 Meanwhile, research on the potential human health effects of fracking remains in its early days. The exposures workgroup cited needs for information on water availability, air quality standards (with guidelines for sampling and analysis), and potential ecosystem impacts, as well as for baseline health data about community members and gas workers. “North Carolina has the advantage of actually being able to do this since there is no prior history of oil and gas production,” says Scott Masten, a senior toxicologist in the National Toxicology Program Division of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. A participant in the exposures workgroup, Masten also delivered a plenary speech on federal government activities related to fracking. Potential health impact issues discussed included the need for comprehensive, ongoing health and demographic data collection, risk modeling, and public awareness campaigns, as well as a stable funding mechanism for all these endeavors. Discussion also centered on establishing best management practices for drillers (well standards, site design standards, inspections, etc.) to help safeguard public health. Hope Taylor, executive director of the nonprofit Clean Water for North Carolina, says there are tens of thousands of private well users in each of the counties that could potentially be affected by gas extraction. “We simply do not know, even in deeper shale formations, all of the conditions that would be required to carry out such operations to prevent contamination,” she says. “In North Carolina’s very shallow and discontinuous shales, groundwater supplies would be at greater risk.” Recommendations from the social impacts workgroup included identification of legal and physical impacts on landowners and others living near drilling locations, economic impacts to affected communities, and impacts to state and local infrastructure that would accompany the increased traffic, equipment, and activities associated with drilling. Hope Taylor pointed out that contractors, investors, pipeline companies, and large landowners would receive most of the economic benefits of development, whereas communities would bear most of the externalized costs related to noise, air emissions, potential drinking well contamination, traffic, and community disruption—a disconnect she said must be considered in impact analyses. According to Emily McGraw, state maintenance operations engineer with the North Carolina Department of Transportation, who participated in a state panel discussion at the summit, the Department of Transportation in Pennsylvania has been helpful with the infrastructural analysis process, providing guidance on permitting and bonding issues for hauling on rural roadways. “The biggest impact will be the weight of the loads coming in . . . [leading to] increased traffic and possible structural deterioration,” she says. Bernard Goldstein, professor emeritus of the Department of Environmental and Occupational Health at the University of Pittsburgh, says planning initiatives such as this summit and the recent Institute of Medicine Roundtable on Shale Gas Extraction9 are beneficial for states that may pursue fracking, and that the industry is getting better at dealing with environmental issues. Goldstein, who did not attend the summit, coauthored a recent EHP commentary on the current lack of a prominent role for the environmental public health community on the advisory boards making recommendations concerning drilling for natural gas.10 He says, “Technology that’s getting better over time has helped drillers do a better job of dealing with what comes up from underground—chemicals, brine, arsenic, radioactivity.” Dennis Devlin, senior environmental health advisor for Exxon Mobil Corporation, agrees. “To ensure that the economic benefits of unconventional gas development continue, our industry is committed to continue properly managing the risks involved with energy production,” he says. “This means meeting the highest standards of well design and integrity. We have rigorous standards in place to monitor and maintain wells after drilling is complete.” Given all the considerations that came out of the summit, would hydraulic fracturing be a feasible enterprise in the state of North Carolina? Yes, says state geologist Taylor, but feasibility would depend on satisfactorily addressing a host of key issues: the implementation of guidelines for hydraulic fracturing, adequate standards for gas well construction, rules on the reuse of wastewater, and the management of drilling waste. Goldstein agrees, and advises policy makers and stakeholders in North Carolina to practice caution, saying it would be best not to advance without more safety and technological advancements to protect public health. Rob Jackson, Nicholas Chair of Global Environmental Change at Duke University’s Nicholas School of the Environment and coauthor of a recent white paper on research and policy recommendations for fracking,11 summed it up for participants: “The best lesson we can learn from Pennsylvania is ‘don’t hurry.’ We need to make sure that we have strong rules and regulations in place, the resources for enough inspectors to do their job, and a commitment to keeping track of everything, from wastewater disposal to the chemical composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids.”","Summit Discusses Public Health Implications of Fracking In the wake of the North Carolina state legislature’s July 2012 vote to legalize new oil and gas exploration,1 the state is poised to join the ranks of others already tapping into shale gas deposits with the help of hydraulic fracturing (fracking).

The present study develops a conceptual framework to examine the psychological process of residents’ acceptance of local SGE, in which the impacts of trust, knowledge, and fairness are mediated by risk and benefit perceptions. Structural equation modeling has been applied to analyze the hypothesized relationships based on a dataset of 825 households in China’s largest shale gas field. Our results indicate that residents’ perceived fairness and trust positively affect their benefit perceptions and negatively affect their risk perceptions, which results in positive influences on acceptance, and knowledge of SGE’s environmental impacts positively affects perceived risks, which results in a negative influence on acceptance. Moreover, residents’ acceptance is primarily determined by their benefit perception, followed by perceived fairness, and knowledge is the least important determinant. Thus, our study contributes to the literature by exploring the structural relationships between various psychological predictors and the acceptance toward SGE, and the results from our empirical survey provide insight into designing appropriate strategies in the process of generating and communicating shale policies.","The Psychological Process of Residents’ Acceptance of Local Shale Gas Exploitation in China Local communities and their opinion on shale gas exploitation (SGE) play an essential role in the implementation of energy policies, while little is known about the reasoning process underpinning the acceptance of SGE.

Unusually, it examines beliefs about positive and negative statements about fracking as well as support/opposition. A majority of respondents correctly answered an initial question testing basic knowledge of shale gas extraction. More respondents supported fracking in Britain (36%) than opposed it (32%) but only 22% supported fracking locally, while 45% were opposed. Respondents were more united in negative beliefs than positive beliefs about fracking. More knowledgeable participants held more polarised views and were significantly more likely than others to agree with negative statements and to oppose fracking in their local area. More respondents disagreed than agreed that it is possible to compensate for fracking risks by payments to local communities. Policy implications include: increasing public knowledge about fracking will not necessarily lead to more positive beliefs and support regarding shale gas developments; promoting alleged economic benefits of shale gas is not enough to ensure support; engaging in genuinely inclusive participatory decision-making may be more likely to increase support than offering payments to communities; alternatively, developing more renewable energy capacity promises to be more popular than fracking.","UK public beliefs about fracking and effects of knowledge on beliefs and support: A problem for shale gas policy Abstract This paper discusses a survey of public opinions on hydraulic fracturing (‘fracking’) for shale gas, conducted with a representative sample of 1745 British adults.

Using an online survey (N = 1457) of the UK public, we find considerable ambivalence about shale gas, but also greater awareness of potential risks than benefits. Prior knowledge is associated with more favourable attitudes, although demographics, political affiliation and environmental values are strongest influences on perceptions. When provided with environmental or economic information about shale gas, participants became more positive – irrespective of their prior values or whether information is framed in terms of losses or gains.

80,80,Understanding public perception of hydraulic fracturing: a case study in Spain.,2017,"Abstract Public acceptance is crucial for the implementation of energy technologies. Hydraulic fracturing is a technology widely used in the USA for natural gas production from shale formations, but currently finds strong public opposition worldwide, especially in Europe. Shale gas exploitation and exploration have the potential to significantly reduce import dependency in several countries, including Spain. To better understand public opinion on this issue, this article reports a survey targeting both the entire Spanish population and the inhabitants of the province of Burgos, the location where shale gas exploration permits have already been issued. Results demonstrate that half of the Spanish population opposes shale gas, and this opposition increases in autonomous communities that are closer to possible exploration sites. The results also show that socio-demographic aspects are not strong predictors of opposition.

Abstract Public acceptance is crucial for the implementation of energy technologies. Hydraulic fracturing is a technology widely used in the USA for natural gas production from shale formations, but currently finds strong public opposition worldwide, especially in Europe. Shale gas exploitation and exploration have the potential to significantly reduce import dependency in several countries, including Spain. To better understand public opinion on this issue, this article reports a survey targeting both the entire Spanish population and the inhabitants of the province of Burgos, the location where shale gas exploration permits have already been issued. Results demonstrate that half of the Spanish population opposes shale gas, and this opposition increases in autonomous communities that are closer to possible exploration sites. The results also show that socio-demographic aspects are not strong predictors of opposition. In addition, Burgos' population show different behaviours toward shale gas that demonstrates that proximity and prospect of shale gas development affects opinion. Finally, there is still a great level of unfamiliarity with high volume hydraulic fracturing and shale gas in both populations sampled.",186,"['population', 'spanish population', 'spanish', 'burgos', 'spain', 'opposition', 'exploration', 'strong', 'public', 'hydraulic fracturing', 'fracturing', 'hydraulic', 'opinion', 'usa natural gas', 'usa natural', 'predictor opposition addition', 'predictor opposition', 'potential significantly reduce', 'potential significantly', 'possible exploration sites']"
81,81,"Using Concepts from the Study of Social Movements to Understand Community Response to Liquefied Natural Gas Development in Clatsop County, Oregon",2019,"Shifts in natural gas supply and demand since the early 2000s have triggered proposals for import and export terminals in coastal locations around the United States. Demand for such facilities is likely to grow with increasing rates of natural gas exports. Clatsop County, Oregon, is one such location that experienced over 10 years of debate surrounding the development of these facilities. The first liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility was proposed in this area in 2004; the final was withdrawn in 2016. While residents expressed both support and opposition early on, opposition dominated by the end. Drawing on insights from the literature on social movements, we conduct a case study of community response to LNG proposals in Clatsop County. We show how opponents were able to successfully frame the potential risks of LNG in a manner that had strong community salience, allowing them to appropriate resources and create political opportunities to advance their cause and influence local and state decisions. Engaging with this case provides an opportunity to observe the behavior and decisions of both opponents and supporters over time, and how they affected project outcomes. LNG proposals in Oregon have been among the most controversial cases of LNG development in the United States. As shale gas development continues to grow, understanding the conflicts involved with its associated infrastructure is critical to creating a more just and equitable energy system.","Using Concepts from the Study of Social Movements to Understand Community Response to Liquefied Natural Gas Development in Clatsop County, Oregon Shifts in natural gas supply and demand since the early 2000s have triggered proposals for import and export terminals in coastal locations around the United States.

83,83,Using role play to explore energy perceptions in the United States and United Kingdom,2018,"Abstract We present the methodology and results of a role-play game that explored energy preferences and decision making criteria for a hypothetical town. Six day-long, mixed-methods workshops focussing on public perceptions of shale gas and oil development were held with highly diverse groups in four urban locations (Los Angeles and Santa Barbara, US; London and Cardiff, UK) and two rural locations (Hirwaun and Winford, UK), N = 83. As part of the workshops, small groups of participants assumed the role of town council members and were asked to debate and rank six energy infrastructure proposals (wind, solar, nuclear, shale gas, shale oil, and coal) in order of preference; a task that stimulated energetic, in-depth discussions around preferences, decision-making criteria, conditions and trade-offs. We reflect on how role-play methodology can be used to elicit insights into the nature of complex decision-making, as well as affording participants clarity and efficacy about decisions, and providing a novel platform by which to engage with energy conundrums. We also elucidate the challenges posed by inevitable disparities between role play and reality, and those associated with materials, framings, and group dynamics. Finally, we make recommendations for extending and refining the methodology, including participant-led framing and cautious consensus building.","Using role play to explore energy perceptions in the United States and United Kingdom Abstract We present the methodology and results of a role-play game that explored energy preferences and decision making criteria for a hypothetical town.

This governance issue calls into question the implementation of environmental principles, such as the principles of prevention, public information and participation, which were constitutionalized in the 2005 Environmental Charter. The hesitations of the French government illustrate the management difficulties at the state level with regards to new unconventional hydrocarbons that have a particular impact on the environment. On 13th July 2011, the legislator adopted a law that prohibited the use of hydraulic fracturing for the prospection of shale gas and oil.

95,95,An analysis of the challenges for groundwater governance during shale gas development in South Africa,2016,"As a prelude to potential development of South Africa’s shale gas resources, it is critical to develop and implement effective groundwater governance arrangements. Existing policies and plans were analysed to determine whether critical gaps or barriers exist that could potentially lead to impacts on groundwater systems. Ten high-priority governance challenges were identified: (a) defining relevant metrics for baseline groundwater quality and availability; (b) developing guidelines for shale gas resource licensing, exploration, drilling, extraction, production, and completion; (c) defining and enforcing compliance monitoring systems; (d) dealing punitively with non-compliant operators; (e) mitigating and managing risks to prevent impairment of groundwater resources; (f) implementing a goal-based regulatory framework; g) enforcing strict chemical disclosure requirements; (h) coordinating across government departments and regulatory bodies meaningfully and productively; (i) implementing a framework for subsidiarity and support to local water management; and (j) providing an incentive framework that supports strong groundwater management and environmental protection. To overcome these challenges, it is recommended that a decentralised, polycentric, bottom-up approach involving multiple institutions is developed to adaptively manage shale gas development. This transition from the current rigid regulatory structure can foster cooperation and collaboration among key stakeholders. The use of a pro-active groundwater governance structure that can accommodate current, near-term, and long-term shale gas development is important for ensuring that future energy development in South Africa incorporates the influence of other simultaneous stressors such as climate (e.g. drought), landuse changes, population growth, industry, and competing demands for water.

Given the uncertainties associated with the decision to leave the European Union (EU), the need to consider its potential effects on the UK’s energy sector becomes even more pertinent. Through the lens of a few widely reviewed trade regimes in the light of Brexit, it can be observed that while UK energy policies are unlikely to change drastically, Brexit nevertheless threatens the UK’s capacity to safeguard its energy supply. The uncertainties following Brexit could arguably starve the UK’s upstream petroleum, electricity, and renewable energy sectors of their required investments. Both short and long-term impacts could result in UK residents paying more per unit of energy consumed in a “hard Brexit” scenario, where the UK exits the Internal Energy Market (IEM) and must trade with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules. While a hard Brexit could aid the growth of the nascent shale gas industry, a negotiated withdrawal that includes some form of access to the IEM (a “soft Brexit”) would be more beneficial for the future of energy security in the UK.","Brexit and Article 50 of the Treaty of the European Union: Implications for UK Energy Policy and Security This paper articulates the potential implications of Brexit on energy policy and security in the United Kingdom (UK).

Charles Powers Estate is causing some uncertainty with respect to the validity of certain natural gas leases in Pennsylvania’s Marcellus Shale region. The issue before the court involved disputed ownership of the natural gas in the Marcellus Shale (and by implication, other unconventional natural gas plays in Pennsylvania). An 1881 deed reserved to Charles Powers, his heirs and assigns, one half the “minerals and Petroleum Oils” beneath the land. The Butlers brought a quite title action against the heirs seeking ownership of the reserved “minerals and petroleum oils” based on adverse possession. The trial court, citing the Dunham Rule, dismissed with prejudice the heirs’ request for a declaratory judgment that the reservation in the deed reserved to the heirs one-half ownership of the natural gas trapped within the Marcellus Shale on the basis that the deed did not specifically reference natural gas. The Superior Court reversed and remanded, reasoning that the Dunham Rule does not end the analysis, absent a more sufficient understanding of whether, among other things: (1) Marcellus Shale constitutes a “mineral”; (2) Marcellus Shale gas constitutes the type of conventional natural gas contemplated in Dunham and subsequent decisions; and (3) Marcellus Shale is similar to coal to the extent that whoever owns the shale, owns the shale gas. The case was remanded to the trial court to develop the record as to whether the Marcellus Shale constitutes a type of “mineral” such that the gas trapped within the shale falls within the deed’s reservation.

Politics and policy of unconventional hydrocarbons in Poland☆,2016,"Abstract The article is based on a throughout analysis of Polish and Western debate on shale gas as well as on interviews with key Polish experts and policymakers, and aims at reconstructing the recent history of development of shale gas in Poland and at mapping how various factors and actors have interacted in this process. Although the country’s membership in the EU makes the understanding of the EU regulatory framework important in this context, the main focus of the article is on how the issues have been addressed in Poland, the country that was believed to be best suited to become European shale gas success story. The article sheds light on how four factors – the national energy governance, social acceptance and geological conditions, combined with the Polish approach to energy security – have contributed to the process of shaping of the Polish policy on development of shale gas in a period between 2005 and 2015. By examining the question of development of unconventional energy resources in the Polish and European context this article seeks to address following questions to be covered in the special issue of the journal: • perceptions of risk and socially constructed debate on unconventional gas; • developments in individual countries (Poland) and in the EU; • national concerns about externalities; • the adequacy of current EU regulation and its reception in member states.","Can the Polish shale gas dog still bark?

102,102,Delaying decarbonization: Climate governmentalities and sociotechnical strategies from Copenhagen to Paris,2020,"Abstract An era (2005–2015) centered around the Copenhagen Accord saw the rise of several immature sociotechnical strategies currently at play: carbon capture and storage, REDD+, next-generation biofuels, shale gas, short-lived climate pollutants, carbon dioxide removal, and solar radiation management. Through a framework grounded in governmentality studies, we point out common trends in how this seemingly disparate range of strategies is emerging, evolving, and taking effect. We find that recent sociotechnical strategies reflect and reinforce governance rationalities emerging during the Copenhagen era: regime polycentrism, relative gains sought in negotiations, ‘co-benefits’ sought with other governance regimes, ‘time-buying’ or ‘bridging’ rationalities, and appeals to vulnerable demographics. However, these sociotechnical systems remain conditioned by the resilient market governmentality of the Kyoto Protocol era. Indeed, the carbon economy exercises a systemic structuring condition: While emerging climate strategies ostensibly present new tracks for signalling ambition and action, they functionally permit the delaying of comprehensive decarbonization.","Delaying decarbonization: Climate governmentalities and sociotechnical strategies from Copenhagen to Paris Abstract An era (2005–2015) centered around the Copenhagen Accord saw the rise of several immature sociotechnical strategies currently at play: carbon capture and storage, REDD+, next-generation biofuels, shale gas, short-lived climate pollutants, carbon dioxide removal, and solar radiation management.

106,106,Environmental Justice and Land Use Conflict: The governance of mineral and gas resource development,2017,"Conflict over the extraction of coal and gas resources has rapidly escalated in communities throughout the world. Using an environmental justice lens, this multidisciplinary book explores cases of land use conflict through the lived experiences of communities grappling with such disputes. Drawing on theories of justice and fairness in environmental decision making, it demonstrates how such land use conflicts concerning resource use can become entrenched social problems, resistant to policy and legal intervention. The author presents three case studies from New South Wales in Australia and Pennsylvania in the US of conflict concerning coal, coal gas and shale gas development. It shows how conflict has escalated in each case, exploring access to justice in land use decision making processes from the perspective of the communities at the heart of these disputes. Weaknesses in contemporary policy and regulatory frameworks, including ineffective opportunities for public participation and a lack of community recognition in land use decision making processes, are explored. The book concludes with an examination of possible procedural and institutional reforms to improve access to environmental justice and better manage cases of land use conflict. Overall, the volume links the philosophies of environmental justice with rich case study findings, offering readers further insight into both the theory and practice of land use decision making.","Environmental Justice and Land Use Conflict: The governance of mineral and gas resource development Conflict over the extraction of coal and gas resources has rapidly escalated in communities throughout the world.

107,107,Fracking in a fractured environment: Shale gas mining and institutional dynamics in South Africa’s young democracy,2018,"Abstract This paper situates the question of shale gas mining in South Africa within broader debates on policy co-ordination within governmental systems. The prospect of shale gas mining has posed severe challenges for the complex inter-governmental system in South Africa. Three key Departments are affected by possible shale gas mining: Mineral Resources, Environmental Affairs and Water Resources. Each of these Departments have different relationships with the provincial and municipal ""spheres of government"". The Department of Mineral Resources has attempted to promote shale gas mining with no reference to municipalities, whereas the other two Departments have attempted to build up municipal capacity. Municipalities have key functions which are protected in the Constitution. However, many municipalities are weak institutions, unwilling to defend their powers. The paper examines Municipal Integrated Development Plans in the potential shale gas region. Most municipalities seem to have no awareness at all of the shale gas issue. Recently, a High Court ruled that any shale gas mining regulations must be made by the Department of Environmental Affairs. With its more decentralist approach to governance, it will mean that municipalities will have more opportunities to participate in shale gas mining decisions.","Fracking in a fractured environment: Shale gas mining and institutional dynamics in South Africa’s young democracy Abstract This paper situates the question of shale gas mining in South Africa within broader debates on policy co-ordination within governmental systems.

Three key Departments are affected by possible shale gas mining: Mineral Resources, Environmental Affairs and Water Resources. Each of these Departments have different relationships with the provincial and municipal ""spheres of government"". The Department of Mineral Resources has attempted to promote shale gas mining with no reference to municipalities, whereas the other two Departments have attempted to build up municipal capacity. Municipalities have key functions which are protected in the Constitution. However, many municipalities are weak institutions, unwilling to defend their powers. The paper examines Municipal Integrated Development Plans in the potential shale gas region. Most municipalities seem to have no awareness at all of the shale gas issue. Recently, a High Court ruled that any shale gas mining regulations must be made by the Department of Environmental Affairs. With its more decentralist approach to governance, it will mean that municipalities will have more opportunities to participate in shale gas mining decisions.",208,"['shale gas mining', 'gas mining', 'mining', 'department', 'municipality', 'municipal', 'south africa', 'africa', 'south', 'attempted', 'governmental', 'mineral', 'resources', 'within', 'key', 'unwilling defend powers', 'unwilling defend', 'unwilling', 'powers paper examines', 'powers paper']"

117,117,Impacts of German energy policies on the competitiveness of national energy intensive industries,2013,"The aim of this paper is to assess the impacts of German energy policies on the competitiveness of national energy intensive industries. The basic idea behind our analysis is that energy policies in Germany create a certain electricity market structure resulting in a certain electricity price, which is a major determinant for the competitiveness of energy intensive industries (e.g. chemicals, paper, aluminum, iron and steel) as energy and electricity constitute a large share in manufacturing costs. The electricity price is the outcome of supply and demand decisions of producers and consumers, with a major supply determinant being the electricity generation technology portfolio. Suboptimal investments within this portfolio are supposed to raise the electricity price and deteriorate the competitiveness of German energy intensive industries. As competitiveness is a relative concept and all world regions are connected via trade, especially in manufacturing, competitiveness occurrences in Germany have direct implications for the competitiveness of energy intensive industries in other European countries, China or the U.S. Our analysis has been motivated by the current discussion about future investment needs of large gas power plants in Germany. Currently, they are crowded out of the electricity market by extensive renewable energy promotion under the German renewable energy law (EEG). This phenomenon is known as the merit-order-effect (Sensfus et al., 2008). Though, this kind of substitution between electricity generation technologies is in part a desired outcome of that energy and climate policy. But this instant potentially affects the security-of-supply-goal of German and European energy policy, particularly in periods with a low feed-in of renewable energies (high residual load). Gas power plants, like gas turbine or combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) plants, are essentially employed in periods with a high residual load, because they are the most flexible in terms of adjusting power level (load-following), which is a valuable feature in times of fluctuating wind and solar power. However, gas power plants typically exhibit the highest marginal costs of non-renewable power plants. This poses the question whether the current energy-only market works correctly or not, i.e. whether the electricity price reflects scarcity of peak-load or load-following capacities sufficiently. If it does, investments in gas power plants are redundant, even in periods with a high residual load. If not, the marginal cost based price would be too low to cover the high investment costs (“missing money” problem). Scarcity could lead to temporary price spikes or even blackouts, if grid restrictions rule out electricity imports from other areas. In that case other mechanisms, such as capacity markets, would be needed to also remunerate capacity provision for peak-load or load-following capacities (cf. Finon & Pignon, 2008). In addition, more and more electricity generation takes place in a decentralized manner. Combined heat and power (CHP) plants and self-supply of industry could reduce the need for large gas power plants. It is not clear what this trend means for the average electricity price. In general, large centralized power plants exhibit lower unit costs of electricity generation compared to distributed generation, owing to economies of scale and higher efficiencies. Nevertheless, we are not following the discussion on this kind of issues here. Rather, we take them as a starting point for our analysis and hypothesize that there is underinvestment of large gas power plants. We ask how this specific energy policy situation in Germany affects the average electricity price and how this consequently impacts on the competitiveness of the energy intensive industries in Germany. This is a central question, because manufacturing has become an important determinant for Germany’s recent macroeconomic resilience. Consequently, there is a discussion whether energy intensive industries should be exempted from certain policies in order not to harm their competitiveness. Besides, energy intensive industries also manufacture substantial components for renewable energy technologies (e.g. steel for wind turbines). Evidence on the significance of energy costs for the placement of manufacturing facilities is also given by recent shale gas and oil discoveries in the U.S. and subsequent energy price falls, which have attracted U.S. companies to move their international manufacturing operations back to the U.S. (The Economist, 2013). In a globalized economy, changes of national competitiveness will affect other countries’ competitiveness. We therefore ask who benefits most from the occurring competitiveness shifts and which of the energy intensive sectors is especially affected. For our global economic analysis, a worldwide macroeconomic model is needed, which represents a closed circular flow of income. Therefore we use the NEWAGE model from IER Stuttgart, which is a global multi-sector computable general equilibrium (CGE) model with a detailed representation of the energy sector and disaggregated electricity generation technologies. Due to the total analytical framework of the general equilibrium approach, the interaction of actors on markets of the economy is described in a closed circular flow of income. This allows capturing both direct effects in individual sectors (e.g. electricity) as well as indirect effects (feedback effects) across the economy that are caused by price-induced supply and demand shifts in response to any political intervention. The basic assumption of the general equilibrium approach is perfect competition on all factor and goods markets. Firms buy production factors and sell goods following cost minimization. Consumers buy these goods using their income from selling the production factors following utility maximization. The government imposes taxes and grants subsidies following guidance and fiscal objectives. The equilibrium system is solved for the variables prices, production levels and income. The NEWAGE model is based on the GTAP database and maps the global economy into 10 countries/regions and 16 sectors. The production of goods in the 16 sectors is modeled with CES (constant elasticity of substitution) production functions, where output is produced as a combination of the input factors capital, labor, energy and materials. The degree to which inputs can be substituted for each other is determined by the respective elasticities of substitution, which are based on technical assumptions or taken from the literature. CO2 allowances are an additional input if fossil fuels are used. The assumption of perfect competition may be waived in special markets, as is done for the labor market in NEWAGE to reflect imbalances existing on real labor markets. Therefore, the model considers unemployment, wage rigidities and different grades of labor qualifications (skilled, unskilled). The dynamic approach is recursive-dynamic applying 5-year milestones from 2010 to 2030. Competitiveness can be measured by different indicators, such as trade balance or trade volume per sector and country, or more complex concepts, such as the Relative World Trade Share (RWS) or the Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) (see Klepper & Peterson, 2008). The RWTS relates the share of national exports and world exports of a sector to the share of total national and total world exports. The RCA relates the national terms-of-trade of one sector to the total national terms-of-trade. The changes in these indicators reflect the production shifts as a result of changes in the input cost structure of the energy intensive industries, i.e. their competitiveness. For analyzing the impacts of possible underinvestment of large gas power plants on the electricity price in Germany and the competitiveness of national energy intensive industries we conduct scenario analysis in a two-stage approach: 1) Effects of underinvestment in large gas power plants on the electricity price (average price) 2) Effects of electricity price changes on sectoral and national competitiveness of energy intensive industries The first step is to fix the production from new gas power plants to the value of 2010, meaning that there are no further investments than already in place. Then we assess the implications of this constraint for the German electricity price and, as a second step, assess the implications of the electricity price change for the competitiveness of the energy intensive industries in Germany and worldwide. We evaluate these experiments against a reference scenario from 2010 to 2030 where moderate gas power investments still occur, even though there is renewable energy promotion via feed-in tariffs. We calculate impacts for all of the above mentioned competitiveness indicators to check for robustness. The effects are measured in a relative manner, which enables us to control for the arbitrary assumptions of the reference scenario and isolate competitiveness effects. This means that we conduct our analysis producing relative, not absolute results regarding physical or monetary units. Within the general equilibrium approach we are able to capture global adjustment processes responding to the impulse of single sectoral or national policy interventions. Our results indicate which countries in the world profit from these energy constraints in Germany, and which of the energy intensive sectors is particularly affected.","Impacts of German energy policies on the competitiveness of national energy intensive industries The aim of this paper is to assess the impacts of German energy policies on the competitiveness of national energy intensive industries.

We therefore ask who benefits most from the occurring competitiveness shifts and which of the energy intensive sectors is especially affected. For our global economic analysis, a worldwide macroeconomic model is needed, which represents a closed circular flow of income. Therefore we use the NEWAGE model from IER Stuttgart, which is a global multi-sector computable general equilibrium (CGE) model with a detailed representation of the energy sector and disaggregated electricity generation technologies. Due to the total analytical framework of the general equilibrium approach, the interaction of actors on markets of the economy is described in a closed circular flow of income. This allows capturing both direct effects in individual sectors (e.g. electricity) as well as indirect effects (feedback effects) across the economy that are caused by price-induced supply and demand shifts in response to any political intervention. The basic assumption of the general equilibrium approach is perfect competition on all factor and goods markets. Firms buy production factors and sell goods following cost minimization. Consumers buy these goods using their income from selling the production factors following utility maximization. The government imposes taxes and grants subsidies following guidance and fiscal objectives. The equilibrium system is solved for the variables prices, production levels and income. The NEWAGE model is based on the GTAP database and maps the global economy into 10 countries/regions and 16 sectors. The production of goods in the 16 sectors is modeled with CES (constant elasticity of substitution) production functions, where output is produced as a combination of the input factors capital, labor, energy and materials. The degree to which inputs can be substituted for each other is determined by the respective elasticities of substitution, which are based on technical assumptions or taken from the literature. CO2 allowances are an additional input if fossil fuels are used. The assumption of perfect competition may be waived in special markets, as is done for the labor market in NEWAGE to reflect imbalances existing on real labor markets. Therefore, the model considers unemployment, wage rigidities and different grades of labor qualifications (skilled, unskilled). The dynamic approach is recursive-dynamic applying 5-year milestones from 2010 to 2030. Competitiveness can be measured by different indicators, such as trade balance or trade volume per sector and country, or more complex concepts, such as the Relative World Trade Share (RWS) or the Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) (see Klepper & Peterson, 2008). The RWTS relates the share of national exports and world exports of a sector to the share of total national and total world exports. The RCA relates the national terms-of-trade of one sector to the total national terms-of-trade. The changes in these indicators reflect the production shifts as a result of changes in the input cost structure of the energy intensive industries, i.e. their competitiveness. For analyzing the impacts of possible underinvestment of large gas power plants on the electricity price in Germany and the competitiveness of national energy intensive industries we conduct scenario analysis in a two-stage approach: 1) Effects of underinvestment in large gas power plants on the electricity price (average price) 2) Effects of electricity price changes on sectoral and national competitiveness of energy intensive industries The first step is to fix the production from new gas power plants to the value of 2010, meaning that there are no further investments than already in place. Then we assess the implications of this constraint for the German electricity price and, as a second step, assess the implications of the electricity price change for the competitiveness of the energy intensive industries in Germany and worldwide. We evaluate these experiments against a reference scenario from 2010 to 2030 where moderate gas power investments still occur, even though there is renewable energy promotion via feed-in tariffs. We calculate impacts for all of the above mentioned competitiveness indicators to check for robustness. The effects are measured in a relative manner, which enables us to control for the arbitrary assumptions of the reference scenario and isolate competitiveness effects. This means that we conduct our analysis producing relative, not absolute results regarding physical or monetary units. Within the general equilibrium approach we are able to capture global adjustment processes responding to the impulse of single sectoral or national policy interventions. Our results indicate which countries in the world profit from these energy constraints in Germany, and which of the energy intensive sectors is particularly affected.",1427,"['competitiveness', 'electricity', 'energy intensive', 'intensive', 'price', 'electricity price', 'energy', 'power', 'gas power', 'intensive industry', 'energy intensive industry', 'germany', 'load', 'plant', 'power plant', 'sector', 'gas power plant', 'german', 'national', 'manufacturing']"
118,118,In Search of the Legal Basis for Environmental and Energy Regulation at the EU Level: The Case of Unconventional Gas Extraction,2014,"The relation of the energy and environmental competences in the European Union (EU) in terms of renewable energy and its promotion and impact on climate change has been subject to intense academic discussion as well as to judicial review. The general tendency is for measures regarding renewable energy to be passed on both competences, depending on the specific content and objective. Other forms of energy, however, have not been included in this debate. The outcome outside the area of renewable energy is expected to be quite different. Shale gas extraction, for example, is associated with negative, or at least problematic, environmental impacts, alongside the benefits it offers to the security of the EU's energy supply. Consequently, the question of competence is not straightforward. This article analyzes the interplay and conflicts between the energy and environmental titles of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union in the context of shale gas activities. The article further explores the importance of ‘significance’ in this setting, and how this concept is crucial in determining the appropriate decision-making procedure to pass a legal measure on shale gas in practice.","In Search of the Legal Basis for Environmental and Energy Regulation at the EU Level: The Case of Unconventional Gas Extraction The relation of the energy and environmental competences in the European Union (EU) in terms of renewable energy and its promotion and impact on climate change has been subject to intense academic discussion as well as to judicial review.

Sufficient data existed in recent decades to support the adoption of precautionary public health policies relating to fossil fuels including shale exploration. Yet air quality and related public health impacts linked to ethical and environmental justice elements are often marginalized or missing in planning and associated decision making. Industry and government policies and practices, laws and planning regulations lagged well behind the science in the United Kingdom. This paper explores the reasons for this and what shaped some of those policies. Why did shale gas policies in England fail to fully address public health priorities and neglect ethical and environmental justice concerns. To answer this question, an interdisciplinary analysis is needed informed by a theoretical framework of how air pollution and climate change are largely discounted in the complex realpolitik of policy and regulation for shale gas development in England. Sources, including official government, regulatory and planning documents, as well as industry and scientific publications are examined and benchmarked against the science and ethical and environmental justice criteria. Further, our typology illustrates how the process works drawing on an analysis of official policy documents and statements on planning and regulatory oversight of shale exploration in England, and material from industry and their consultants relating to proposed shale oil and gas development. Currently the oil, gas and chemical industries in England continue to dominate and influence energy and feedstock-related policy making to the detriment of ethical and environmental justice decision making with significant consequences for public health.","Lagging and Flagging: Air Pollution, Shale Gas Exploration and the Interaction of Policy, Science, Ethics and Environmental Justice in England.

120,120,Mineral Energy Sources and Political Activities: Introduction to Mutual Dependencies and Their Selected Exemplification,2014,"The mineral energy sources, possessed by a certain state or remaining an object of interest for it, may form a basis for political activities, both oriented on usage either of the purely political (non-militarized) or militarized methods. The usage of these sources in the political context may have a natural impact on the essence of sustainable development, especially then if to juxtapose it with previous experiences of the mankind. The natural gas based energy policy seems to be the key factor for the above political activities of states with imperial ambitions, as the contemporary Russia. Referring to the shale gas, the syndrome as such concerns the monopolistic position of the USA in terms of the applied exploitation technologies. The size of coal mining and steel production at the turn of the 19th and 20th century, or oil fields’ possession and their usage before and during WW II used to play such a role in the past. In both of these cases there were necessary prerequisites for planning the military campaigns in potential wars (envisaged as successful indeed). Fortunately such an extreme way of conducting political activities is not confirmed today. Following the same trace the policy of the possessed energy sources’ usage, or taking over those being in possession of others, might ultimately lead towards maintaining an economic and perhaps political supremacy of ones over others. On the one hand it demonstrates the policy of pressure led by stronger, imperially oriented states against weaker and dependent ones. On the other one, it shows the results of the mutual antagonizing policy of the latter stimulated by the stronger state- and non-state-like entities, having their own interests. Due to some experiences, taken from the most recent past, one can speculate, if the possessed or desired energy sources may be utilized as a tool for unequivocally political decisions, also in the military sphere. It is hard to be optimistic bearing in mind the rule that history tends to repeat itself. Such scepticism is even deeper if we realize that the control over the water reserves remains a source of the future large-scale international conflicts.","Mineral Energy Sources and Political Activities: Introduction to Mutual Dependencies and Their Selected Exemplification The mineral energy sources, possessed by a certain state or remaining an object of interest for it, may form a basis for political activities, both oriented on usage either of the purely political (non-militarized) or militarized methods.

121,121,Monitoring Marcellus: A Case Study of a Collaborative Volunteer Monitoring Project to Document the Impact of Unconventional Shale Gas Extraction on Small Streams,2016,"The rapid growth of the natural gas extraction industry in Pennsylvania and neighboring states has stirred concerned citizens to seek ways to collect data on water quality impacts from the extraction activi- ties. As a response to requests from community members, the Alliance for Aquatic Resource Monitoring (ALLARM) developed a volunteer-friendly protocol in 2010 for early detection and reporting of surface water contamination by shale gas extraction activities in small streams. To date, ALLARM has trained more than 2,000 volunteers in Pennsylvania, New York, and West Virginia to monitor water quality (conductivity, barium, strontium, and total dissolved solids) and physical parameters (stream stage and visual observations) prior to, during, and after shale gas wells have been developed. This paper documents the operational models of Public Participation in Scientific Research (PPSR) used by ALLARM, describes the volunteer monitoring protocol developed, and examines three years of water quality results from hundreds of monitoring sites in Pennsylvania and New York. The majority of watersheds monitored are small, forested, headwater streams. Results indicate that mean conductivity in streams is strongly and positively related to the percentage of development and the percentage of limestone in the watersheds. Mean conductivity is not significantly related to number or density of drilled wells, although the dataset did not lend itself to finding a signal from shale gas activities because only 20% of the watersheds had wells drilled at the time of sampling. This fact enables the use of these data as baseline data for future documentation of shale gas impacts on water quality. Volunteers have reported multiple cases of visual pollution related to shale gas activities, but have not identified water contamination events based on stream water chemistry. The results of the volunteer dataset are compared with results from the scientific literature, affirming the credibility and usefulness of the data. Some lessons learned from this project include: The importance of strong and timely support to volunteers to ensure accurate reporting in real-time; the unique role that citi- zen scientists can play in a rural landscape where well sites are remote and government oversight is not prac- tical; and the importance of customizing a PPSR operational model to fit the goals and scale of the project. Recommendations for continued collection and analysis of data include: 1) develop and implement an intentional study design to monitor those watersheds that now have baseline data once drilling begins, 2) target watersheds whose characteristics are under-represented in this dataset, 3) consider the analysis of additional parameters and the monitoring of high risk systems, 4) develop a central, user-friendly data- base for volunteers to submit their own data and receive preliminary analyses, and 5) partner with other volunteer data collectors to collaborate with data analysis and interpretation.","Monitoring Marcellus: A Case Study of a Collaborative Volunteer Monitoring Project to Document the Impact of Unconventional Shale Gas Extraction on Small Streams The rapid growth of the natural gas extraction industry in Pennsylvania and neighboring states has stirred concerned citizens to seek ways to collect data on water quality impacts from the extraction activi- ties.

122,122,Multi-criteria decision making and fairness evaluation of water ecological carrying capacity for inter-regional green development.,2021,"Determining water ecological carrying capacity (WECC) is of great significance to ensure inter-regional green development. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation framework for WECC assessment in the Yangtze River Economic Zone (YREZ), China. Effects of water resources, socio-economic, and ecological elements on WECC can be evaluated based on multi-criteria decision analysis. Gini and unbalance coefficients are used for measuring the regional fairness between WECC and socio-economic development. Surface water production pressure (SWPP) and groundwater pollution risk (GPR) are further regarded as indicators for expressing water resources constraint on shale gas extraction in the YREZ. Results disclose that the average WECC level decreases from 0.439 in 2000 to 0.4007 in 2016, which is the opposite of the changing trend in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region. A high WECC level appears in Zhejiang (0.5126) with a good state, but that of Guizhou (0.3983), Anhui (0.3968), Hunan (0.3914), and Chongqing (0.3651) are at the alert state. The obstacle factors of WECC in the eastern YREZ mostly originate from socio-economic and water resource subsystems, while that in the middle and western YREZ mainly arise from water resources and ecological subsystems. Fairness analysis shows a well-matching characteristic between the overall WECC and socio-economic performances due to a majority of their Gini coefficients lower than 0.4, while a poor matching characteristic exists in terms of provincial differences owing to their varied unbalance coefficients, especially in Guizhou, Jiangsu, and Shanghai. Moreover, Chongqing with most of shale gas reserves is characterized by slight SWPP (1.0202) and GPR (0.0188), but the prospect of shale gas development in Sichuan is not optimistic due to its high SWPP (1.0846) and GPR (0.0647). Recycling of flowback and product waters can significantly lighten regional water resources pressure. This presented framework can be applied into many other Chinese cities (e.g., Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region) with slight modifications according to their actual situations for supporting water resource managers and government with decision making.","Multi-criteria decision making and fairness evaluation of water ecological carrying capacity for inter-regional green development.

124,124,"NEPA, Climate Change, and Public Lands Decision-Making",2011,"One of the most difficult challenges facing public land managers today is how to address climate change in a meaningful way when making decisions affecting public lands. This problem is largely the product of the high levels of uncertainty surrounding climate change and the potential consequences of climate change for the large and complex landscapes and ecosystems that public land agencies manage.In February 2010, the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) issued draft guidance to federal agencies describing how these agencies should address climate change in their decision documents. Recognizing the difficulty of the task, however, the CEQ’s draft guidance expressly disclaimed any intention of affording assistance to public land management agencies making complex land use decisions. NEPA, Climate Change and Public Lands Decision-Making seeks to fill that gap. It begins by describing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the unique difficulties in applying NEPA to climate change and public land management. It then considers three case studies that illustrate the complex challenges that face public land managers, including: (1) the Forest Service’s treatment of the Mountain Pine Beetle in Colorado and Southern Wyoming; (2) the Regional Water Supply Pipeline proposal to bring 250,000 acre feet of water from the Colorado River Basin to the Front Range of Colorado and Southern Wyoming; and (3) fossil fuel leasing on public lands in general, with specific discussions of shale gas fracking, coal mine methane, and oil shale extraction. These case studies form the basis for a series of recommendations for the CEQ and land use planning agencies. Most importantly, the article recommends that land use planning agencies quantify the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that result from their proposed actions and attach a price to those emissions that reflects the marginal social cost of climate change that might result from those emissions. Although the social cost of GHG emissions may be uncertain, assigning a price to those emissions that reflects their social cost will promote more accurate cost assessments, and ensures that such costs become a meaningful part of the decision-making process. The article also recommends that the CEQ propose rules to ensure that agencies are held accountable when they commit to adaptive management in their decision documents. Finally, the article offers several general recommendations for coping effectively with the uncertainty and scale of climate change.","NEPA, Climate Change, and Public Lands Decision-Making One of the most difficult challenges facing public land managers today is how to address climate change in a meaningful way when making decisions affecting public lands.

127,127,Participatory Air Monitoring in the Midst of Uncertainty: Residents’ Experiences with the Speck Sensor,2017,"How do participants engage in at-home air monitoring in the midst of uncertain exposures to airborne emissions associated with unconventional natural gas development (UNGD) activities? We investigate residents’ experiences with the “Speck” particulate matter sensor with an emerging environmental health resource center called the Southwest Pennsylvania Environmental Health Project (EHP).  In response to the gaps in knowledge about the health impacts of UNGD and the growth citizen science tools, participatory environmental monitoring (PEM) projects have taken off in shale gas communities. Using interview and survey data from residents, advocates, and activists we show that residents use the Speck as: 1) “environmental health thermometers” to make real time decisions based on readings; 2) real-time tools of exposure-validation to immediately validate or invalidate suspicions of exposure; 3) “epistemic objects” or tools manipulated in exploratory ways to understand their efficacy in monitoring UNGD; and 4) passively by those who chose to rarely interact with the monitors and rather waited for overall analysis of results.  While PEM’s have been critiqued for potentially passing the burden of monitoring onto communities, our research shows PEM, when connected with research and public health organizations like EHP, can both empower individuals by increasing their perceived and actual agency and build collective knowledge by producing novel scientific findings. The modes of participation identified here each imply individual and community-level outcomes. When connected with an organization like EHP, Speck monitoring enabled participating individual the latitude to develop their own research and make immediate use of the data, while also creating data useful for aggregated scientific analyses that provoke new questions about the health risks associated with UNGD.","Participatory Air Monitoring in the Midst of Uncertainty: Residents’ Experiences with the Speck Sensor How do participants engage in at-home air monitoring in the midst of uncertain exposures to airborne emissions associated with unconventional natural gas development (UNGD) activities?

131,131,Policy recommendations to promote shale gas development in China based on a technical and economic evaluation,2015,"Because of its resource potential and clean burning advantages, the development of shale gas can significantly increase the supply of cleaner energy while offering the associated benefits. To foster shale gas development, many policy incentives have been introduced in China. However, the current incentives have not been sufficiently aggressive, and the shale gas industry has been slow to develop. Existing policies thus need to be further improved. To provide effective support for decision makers in China, a technical and economic evaluation is performed in this study to explore the profitability of shale gas production in pilot zones. The results show that shale gas production is subeconomic under the current technical and economic conditions. Based on this evaluation, a policy analysis is conducted to investigate the profitability improvement offered by the major policies available in China to elucidate a path toward improving incentive policies. The results indicate that policy instruments related to gas prices, financial subsidies, corporate income taxes or combinations thereof could be used as priority options to improve policy incentives.

Over the next two decades, CO2 capture and sequestration (CCS) demonstration projects would need to increase several orders of magnitude across the globe in both size and scale. This task has several potential barriers which will have to be accounted for. These barriers include those that have been known for a number of years including safety of subsurface sequestration, pore-space competition with emerging activities like shale gas production, legal and regulatory frameworks, and public acceptance and technical communication. In addition water management is a new challenge that should be actively and carefully considered across all CCS operations. A review of the new insights gained on these previously and newly identified challenges, since the IPCC special report on CCS, is presented in this paper. While somewhat daunting in scope, some of these challenges can be addressed more easily by recognizing the potential advantageous synergies that can be exploited when these challenges are dealt with in combination. For example, active management of water resources, including brine in deep subsurface formations, can provide the additional cooling-water required by the CO2 capture retrofitting process while simultaneously reducing sequestration leakage risk and furthering efforts toward public acceptance. This comprehensive assessment indicates that water, sequestration, legal, and public acceptance challenges ought to be researched individually, but must also be examined collectively to exploit the promising synergies identified herein. Exploitation of these synergies provides the best possibilities for successful large-scale implementation of CCS.","Promising synergies to address water, sequestration, legal, and public acceptance issues associated with large-scale implementation of CO2 sequestration Stabilization of CO2 atmospheric concentrations requires practical strategies to address the challenges posed by the continued use of coal for baseload-electricity production.

133,133,Regulating Water Security in Unconventional Oil and Gas: An Introduction,2020,"The last 20 years have seen dramatic growth in the production of oil and gas from shale, as production techniques developed in the latter half of the twentieth century have advanced under largely favorable economic conditions. Hydraulic fracturing is a well stimulation technique in which sand and other proppants suspended in fluids are forced at high pressure through cracks in shale rock to free hydrocarbons to flow to the surface. This requires significant volumes of water and presents challenges for protecting nearby humans and the environment from water, air, and noise pollution, as well as other effects of the activity. Legal, policy, and regulatory issues related to the use of water for hydraulic fracturing are present at every stage of such “unconventional” operations. Operators must understand the legal, political and hydrological context of their surroundings, gain community cooperation or confront social resistance, procure water for use in the fracturing and extraction processes, collect flowback and produced water, and dispose of these waters safely. A recent study found significant increases in water use for hydraulic fracturing and wastewater production in major shale gas and oil production regions, with attendant increases in water-use intensity over time (i.e., water use normalized to the energy production) (Kondash et al. 2018). The water volumes required for hydraulic fracturing are only likely to grow over time, as will the challenges of meeting that demand, and of disposing of wastewater associated with that production. This book considers how regulators and other decision makers have addressed many of these issues, considering varying legal frameworks, political systems, social acceptance, and geologies around the world (Fig. 1.1).","Regulating Water Security in Unconventional Oil and Gas: An Introduction The last 20 years have seen dramatic growth in the production of oil and gas from shale, as production techniques developed in the latter half of the twentieth century have advanced under largely favorable economic conditions.

Violations related to spills and erosion were most commonly issued. A single change in policy resulted in a 45% decrease in environmental violation rates. Furthermore, for every 1% increase in wells drilled per inspections conducted, there was a 0.56% decrease in environmental violation rates. Similar effects were not found for administrative violations. Operator identity, price of gas, and other major policies were not significantly correlated with violation rates. In comparing conventional and shale gas extraction compliance we found that shale gas development entails more risk related to spills and solid waste management, while conventional development entails more risk associated with cementing and casing issues, and site restoration.","Shale gas operator violations in the Marcellus and what they tell us about water resource risks Abstract Development of shale gas entails environmental risk, particularly with respect to water resources, and stakeholders are keen to assess such risks before making development decisions.

We investigate the networked governance of affordable housing impacts in the Marcellus Shale gas region of the United States to empirically illuminate the dynamics of state and private meta-governance. Drawing on a qualitative research approach, we identify public authorities as exercising what seems to be predominant responsibility for meta-governance, with state government having strong influence over the structure and resourcing of a networked governance response, and county government directly facilitating the collaborative engagement of actors at the local level. Although private oil and gas companies demonstrate little involvement in network governance, the presence of private meta-governance in the alternative form of the design of market governance is shown to have a number of countervailing implications for the form and function of network governance. We suggest that expansion of the concept of “framing” to account for strategies that structure how key governance actors understand a particular problem provides valuable insights for understanding private meta-governance in relation to network governance.","Steering Social Outcomes in America’s Energy Heartland State and Private Meta-Governance in the Marcellus Shale, Pennsylvania This article argues that analysis of meta-governance purely in terms of the actions of the state can obscure the significant, but less apparent, ways in which private actors may influence the choices and interactions of individuals within various modes of governance coordination.

We suggest that expansion of the concept of “framing” to account for strategies that structure how key governance actors understand a particular problem provides valuable insights for understanding private meta-governance in relation to network governance.",216,"['meta governance', 'meta', 'governance', 'private', 'private meta governance', 'private meta', 'network governance', 'network', 'state private meta', 'state private', 'networked governance', 'state', 'actor', 'networked', 'structure', 'marcellus shale', 'marcellus', 'influence', 'form', 'various mode governance']"
145,145,Strategic ignorance and politics of time: how expert knowledge framed shale gas policies,2020,"The article addresses the various uses of expert knowledge during the controversy over shale gas in France and in Quebec (Canada). Cross-fertilization between policy analysis and science and technology studies demonstrates that political uses of expertise better explained the policymaking process in focusing on two specific utilizations: strategic ignorance and politics of time. Using data from press analysis, interviews, reports and documentation analysis, the article shows that social movements can also use strategic ignorance to support their environmental claims and that mastering the pace of the controversy and the policy debates enabled actors to better support their policy claims. The French case illustrates those two arguments while the Quebec case provides a more tradition account of State/Industry's utilization of knowledge production to delay decision and divert opposition.","Strategic ignorance and politics of time: how expert knowledge framed shale gas policies The article addresses the various uses of expert knowledge during the controversy over shale gas in France and in Quebec (Canada).

In response, DFW municipalities adopted gas well drilling ordinances and enacted setback distance policies to regulate the proximity between new gas wells and homes. However, landscape and planning impacts arising from subsequent development of homes around hydrocarbon extraction sites are unknown. Here, we use quantitative and qualitative methods to 1) quantify spatial and land-use effects of gas well production sites, 2) identify municipal staff perspectives on overlapping gas well and suburban landscapes, and 3) evaluate municipal governance strategies for dealing with subsequent development of homes around production sites. Our results show that production sites occupy approximately 3000 ha in DFW and nearly 2% of surface areas in some high growth municipalities. Over time, developed land covers increasingly surrounded gas production sites. We identified three statistically significant social perspectives among municipal officials, two indicating concern with how gas wells impede future urban development. The majority of municipal governments place the onus on homebuyers to decide whether to live near gas wells, though a few municipalities require notification of their presence. The parallel pressures to develop surface and mineral interests by two powerful industries – property developers and oil and gas operators, respectively – create a complex regulatory and planning environment for municipalities where protections of resident health, safety, and welfare are left to the discretion of corporate entities and social licenses.","Suburbanization and shale gas wells: Patterns, planning perspectives, and reverse setback policies Abstract From 2002 to 2015, the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex (DFW) experienced high population growth rates and booming shale gas production via hydraulic fracturing of the Barnett Shale.

The UK shale development case is of particular interest currently as the Government attempts to position the UK as a pioneer of European, safe, sustainable shale gas development.

We identify nine key frames and their associated storylines, analyse their use over time, and compare these findings with other national case studies. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given most UK Governments within our timeframe have supported shale development, pro-shale development frames dominate in the policy debate; however, we also find a high level of anti-shale development frame use, suggesting a deep and ongoing framing contest in national formal political sites. We find in particular a more prominent focus on land-use issues and impacts on the landscape than other UK studies or other national contexts. Conceptually, the study puts forward an integrative approach to the related concepts of frames and storylines, as well as arguments concerning the impotence of storylines in anticipatory political debate and the polyvalence of framing strategies.

This article applies argumentative discourse analysis to the Scottish debate over UGD and identifies several important storylines which have mobilised different discourse coalitions and shaped public opinion as well as policy-making. For now, anti-UGD storylines appear more encompassing and have achieved greater resonance. Of particular interest, however, is the role of the Scottish government as a third discourse coalition. Through a moratorium on all forms of UGD and a cautious ‘evidence-based approach', the government has established a form of discursive dominance and has successfully minimised electoral risks. But its anti-Westminster storyline – created in the run-up to the Scottish independence referendum in 2014 – has undermined the government's pragmatic strategy by invoking Scottish resistance to the UK’s pursuit of shale gas. While the evidence-based approach persists as the preeminent storyline, its interpretation has ‘drifted’ from (1) a modestly reformed planning policy to (2) an exercise in scientific fact-finding combined with a public consultation and, arguably, (3) to a precautionary approach that might lay the foundation for an extended moratorium.","The discursive politics of unconventional gas in Scotland: Drifting towards precaution?

151,151,The Fracking Revolution: Shale Gas as a Case Study in Innovation Policy,2015,"The early twenty-first century has witnessed a boom in oil and natural gas production that promises to turn the United States into a new form of petrostate. This boom raises various questions that scholars have begun to explore, including questions of risk governance, federalism, and export policy. Relatively neglected, however, have been questions of why the technological revolution behind the boom occurred and what this revolution teaches about innovation theory and policy. The boom in U.S. shale gas production reflected long-gestating infrastructure developments, a convergence of technological advances, government-sponsored research and development, the presence or absence of intellectual property rights, rights in tangible assets such as land and minerals, and tax and regulatory relief. Consequently, the story behind the boom reaches far beyond the risk-taking and persistence of George Mitchell, whose independent production company achieved pioneering success with hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) in Texas’ Barnett Shale. Indeed, the broader story demonstrates how a blend of distinct policy levers, reasonably adjusted over time, can combine to foster a diverse innovation ecosystem that provides a robust platform for game-changing innovation. As exemplified by this story, the centrality of other policy levers can mean that patents play only a modest role even in spurring technological development by profit-driven private players. Finally, the Article demonstrates how. Such lessons can helpfully inform efforts either to extend the United States’ “fracking revolution” abroad or to develop other potentially revolutionary technologies such as those associated with renewable energy. Lessons drawn from this case study include “negative lessons” about the possibility and even likelihood of downsides of a technological boom or the policies used to promote it — for example, environmental damage that more careful regulation of a developing technology such as fracking might have avoided. Anticipatory and continuing attention to such potential downsides can help prevent innovation-promoting policies from becoming “sticky” in a way that undercuts innovation’s promise and popular appeal.","The Fracking Revolution: Shale Gas as a Case Study in Innovation Policy The early twenty-first century has witnessed a boom in oil and natural gas production that promises to turn the United States into a new form of petrostate.

A number of common themes emerge from the case studies, for example: the limited capacity of government, the role of the national oil companies and other interested economic actors, complex approval procedures, poor coordination between different government agencies and between different levels of government, access to land, and inadequate infrastructure, as well as the inappropriate nature of the prevailing laws, regulations and contracts designed for the extraction of conventional hydrocarbons. Despite these commonalities, the specific nature of each potential constraint and their relative importance varies between each country and even across an individual country.

156,156,The politics of Asian fracking: Public risk perceptions towards shale gas development in China,2019,"Abstract Growing attention has been paid to understanding public risk perceptions of shale gas development. This research has largely been conducted in the United States and Europe. Arguably, the environmental and social risks posed by drilling are potentially more severe in places like China, due to its geography and political system. However, little is known how those constantly exposed to risks (the “affected” public) evaluate these risks. In this study, in-depth interviews were conducted with local residents (n=25) in Weiyuan County, Sichuan Province, the region with the largest shale gas reserves in the country, to identify the perceived risks of the affected Chinese public and to explore underlying factors that impact risk perception. Our results suggest that affected Chinese residents were most concerned about groundwater contamination and air pollution above all other risks, and they tended to link risks to spatial proximity to shale gas wells. The multifaceted nature of perceived benefits played a novel and nuanced role in Chinese residents’ risk perception. Pride and disempowerment were found to attenuate the risk judgments of affected Chinese residents, which has not been observed in previous literature. Our findings provides policymakers with insight into how to improve risk communications to enhance understanding of affected publics, as well as to better design compensation schemes that may address inequities.","The politics of Asian fracking: Public risk perceptions towards shale gas development in China Abstract Growing attention has been paid to understanding public risk perceptions of shale gas development.

157,157,The role of ethics in shale gas policies.,2014,"The United States has experienced a boom in natural gas production due to recent technological innovations that have enabled natural gas to be produced from unconventional sources, such as shale. There has been much discussion about the costs and benefits of developing shale gas among scientists, policy makers, and the general public. The debate has typically revolved around potential gains in economics, employment, energy independence, and national security as well as potential harms to the environment, the climate, and public health. In the face of scientific uncertainty, national and international governments must make decisions on how to proceed. So far, the results have been varied, with some governments banning the process, others enacting moratoria until it is better understood, and others explicitly sanctioning shale gas development. These policies reflect legislature's preferences to avoid false negative errors or false positive ones. Here we argue that policy makers have a prima facie duty to minimize false negatives based on three considerations: (1) protection from serious harm generally takes precedence over the enhancement of welfare; (2) minimizing false negatives in this case is more respectful to people's autonomy; and (3) alternative solutions exist that may provide many of the same benefits while minimizing many of the harms.","The role of ethics in shale gas policies.

158,158,There’s no real choice but to sign: neoliberalization and normalization of hydraulic fracturing on Pennsylvania farmland,2014,"Finewood and Stroup (J Contemp Water Res Educ 147(1), 72–79, 2012) observe that as hydraulic fracturing for natural gas spreads across the USA, neoliberal ideologies normalize fracking’s potential dangers, including impacts to water and more general environmental quality. Theoretical observations like these must be tested empirically. I do so here, analyzing data from extensive fieldwork in Pennsylvania’s Bradford, Susquehanna, and Washington counties. Drawing on comparative mixed method data from fieldwork in northeastern Pennsylvania’s ‘Endless Mountains’ region and the Pittsburgh area, I compare how small-scale farmers perceive and sometimes enact elements of market-based, neoliberal rationality when assessing hydrofracking’s community, environmental, and economic outcomes. This paper explores why this matters sociologically, given small-scale farmers’ roles as land-use decision-makers, stewards of related natural resource development, and marginalized producers with limited access to market shares and subsidies. In counties like Bradford and Washington, impacts of fracking small-scale farmers have been under-studied. To address that gap, I examine impacts on farmers operating around natural gas development and within neoliberal economic structures. Analyzing extensive interview and ethnographic data, the following research questions are addressed: (1) Among small-scale farmers impacted by hydraulic fracturing, what evidence exists that neoliberal logic helps farmers normalize fracking? and (2) How does normalization interact with decisions to sign natural gas leases? My findings indicate that many farmers utilize neoliberal logic when assessing impacts of hydraulic fracturing and shale gas development, particularly as rapid energy development relates to their land-use decisions. Neoliberal normalization of hydraulic fracturing emerges most saliently regarding environmental outcomes and economic development. I connect this to small-scale farmers’ economic vulnerability and the limited agency in dictating land use near their farms.","There’s no real choice but to sign: neoliberalization and normalization of hydraulic fracturing on Pennsylvania farmland Finewood and Stroup (J Contemp Water Res Educ 147(1), 72–79, 2012) observe that as hydraulic fracturing for natural gas spreads across the USA, neoliberal ideologies normalize fracking’s potential dangers, including impacts to water and more general environmental quality.

161,161,Understanding Local Regulation of Fracking: A Spatial Econometric Approach,2015,"(ProQuest: ... denotes formulae omitted.)High-volume hydraulic fracturing, also known as fracking, of underground shale gas deposits to capture natural gas is a controversial practice but one that is thriving in many areas of the United States. Concerns regarding fracking include local air and water quality, impacts on traffic from trucks required to move waste water and other materials, and social impacts related to a ""boomtown"" mentality. In recent years, several states have scrambled to address a lack of coherent fracking and shale gas regulation. Wyoming, Texas, Colorado, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Maryland have all significantly revised and strengthened their fracking regulations. Other states are in the middle of significant revisions that could result in some of the most forceful and comprehensive fracking regulations in the United States. Despite this, one can argue that no state yet has a comprehensive set of regulations, and states and municipalities can learn much from each other and from better information and analyses.Thirty home-rule states (and nine states with limited home-rule status) allow local communities to pass laws that extend restrictions on fracking beyond limits established by the state legislature. As a result, municipalities, townships, and counties can establish more effective, locally focused strategies and create variation in policy responses to potential negative impacts of shale gas drilling in their jurisdictions. We combine a comprehensive data set on local bans and moratoria in the state of New York with local-level census data and spatial characteristics linked through a geographic information system (GIS) in a spatial econometric analysis of local fracking policies. These data allow us to explore the determinants of local regulations that allow (or ban) fracking activities in New York, our test-case state. Despite New York's decision in December 2014 to maintain its state-level moratorium indefinitely (Kaplan 2014), this research is important given the prevalence of home-rule legislation in many states where fracking is occurring.A variety of factors can account for variation in local-level and state-level policymaking. For instance, adoption of policies related to renewable resource portfolio standards has been shown to be associated with economic, resourcebased, geographic, competitive, and political characteristics (Huang et al. 2007, Chandler 2009, Carley and Miller 2012). We expect that extensive state and local variation similarly will play a part in accounting for variation in fracking regulations.Understanding the determinants of local decision-making allows scholars and policymakers to differentiate the economic, cultural, risk, geographic, and sociodemographic factors underlying acceptance and resistance (Wustenhagen, Wolsink, and Burer 2007). With that information, stakeholders, government agencies, and resource developers can craftbetter solutions via bargaining, negotiations, improved mitigation measures, and education efforts or refuse development when such solutions are not available. Improved understanding also can alert policymakers to potential coopting of the process and concerns regarding environmental justice and/or make it easier for developers to craftbetter implementation plans that incur less opposition and produce more effective and efficient outcomes. Knowledge about the determinants of local policymaking, in this case related to fracking, can be applied broadly to acceptance of other energy facility and infrastructure projects (e.g., wind turbines) and to other public policy questions.Our econometric approach and GIS data set allow us to account for spatial clustering to determine the extent to which local policy actions are correlated with actions of nearby communities. This analysis allows us to determine whether spatially correlated unobserved influences have an effect on community actions even after controlling for demographic characteristics and other features. …","Understanding Local Regulation of Fracking: A Spatial Econometric Approach (ProQuest: ... denotes formulae omitted.)High-volume hydraulic fracturing, also known as fracking, of underground shale gas deposits to capture natural gas is a controversial practice but one that is thriving in many areas of the United States.

163,163,Who governs? Changing the representation of the common good - the case of shale gas in Quebec,2012,"In several countries, the exploration and exploitation of shale gas has become a politically controversial issue. Our paper analyses the case of shale gas exploration in the province of Quebec. Explorations by private companies, undertaken in 2009 and 2010, have provoked strong reactions from organized groups and citizens. The mobilisation by civil society has led to important changes in the governance of shale gas in Quebec. At first, the exploitation and exploration of shale gas was understood as solely a question of economic development through private investment. With the growing mobilisation, however, the debate has turned into a much broader discussion of Quebec's economic and political development. This shift in public debate is the result of a combination of factors: the growing articulation of social protest at different scales (from local towns to national coalitions and international networks); popular education via mobilizations and media exposure; and consultation conducted through an independent, public participatory venue. In this paper, we address the nature of this change from the point of view of interest formation. We argue that the spatial dimension in terms of territory, place, and scale of the conflict articulates itself differently for the actors involved in each arena of conflict. While for social actors the spatial dimension of the shale gas conflict empowered their movement, the contrary was the case for economic interests.","Who governs?

164,164,Fuel to the fire : Risk governance and framing of shale gas in the Netherlands,2018,"Abstract Public resistance to shale gas in the Netherlands came as a surprise to governing actors. The Netherlands was a ‘gas land’ and shale gas extraction had been successfully framed as ‘business as usual’. However, in the eyes of the general public it turned into a ‘risky business’, and national government had to adjust their risk governance strategies. This study of the dynamics between national government’s risk governance strategies, framing, and societal responses, shows that this wicked problem could not be managed by authoritative risk governance strategies, nor by collaborative risk governance strategies. Rather, these strategies added fuel to the fire, and resistance increased. The results indicate that all sorts of risk governance strategies, but especially collaborative risk governance strategies, should better take into account the normative dimensions of a conflict, and reflect on who is the legitimate actor to govern the issue. This ‘controversy governance’ includes the possibility to discuss the desirability and necessity of mining activities, and a reflection on who is a legitimate decision maker on a wicked problem.","Fuel to the fire : Risk governance and framing of shale gas in the Netherlands Abstract Public resistance to shale gas in the Netherlands came as a surprise to governing actors.

Emissions factors for shale gas and LNG remain poorly characterized and contested in the academic literature, and context-specific factors have significant impacts on the lifecycle emissions of shale gas but have not been evaluated. Moreover, while the province has attempted to frame natural gas development within its ambitious climate change policy, this framing misrepresents substantive policy on gas production. The ‘‘transition fuel’’ and ‘‘climate solution’’ labels applied to development by the BC provincial government risk legitimizing carbon-intensive gas development. We argue that policy makers in BC and beyond should abandon the ‘‘transition fuel’’ characterization of natural gas.

These include both the will to seize opportunities, primarily economic ones, as the Arctic opens up and the need to secure Russian sovereign rights in the region. Another factor has been the surge of interest in Arctic matters expressed by countries around the world, including by Asian states. This trend has fueled Moscow's determination to defend the Russian position against the perceived threat of being pushed out of the region by foreign actors eager to develop their own activities.For some time, Russia has been reluctant to accept increased influence in the region by non-Arctic actors that could potentially challenge Russia's status and interests. This coolness to newcomers applies to the Arctic Council's new Asian observers-China, Japan, India, South Korea, and Singapore-as well as to outside states and organizations in general. Although Russia intends to strengthen cooperation in the future, such cooperation is to occur on one condition: it must not challenge Russia's sovereign rights in the Arctic, including offshore areas.This essay analyses Russia's attitudes toward Asian interests in the Arctic. First, it examines Russia's key Arctic interests and policies and the challenges to their implementation. Next, it sheds light on Moscow's views on the admission of the five Asian states as observers in the Arctic Council, as well as on the motivations behind their policies toward the region. Finally, the essay analyses Russia's views on the actual and potential risks and gains as it seeks to balance mutually beneficial cooperation with the need to preserve its own influence, rights, and interests in the Arctic.Russia's Arctic Interests: New Opportunities, New UncertaintyRussian policy fundaments, the resulting Arctic strategy, and the plan for its implementation all draw on the country's relatively high-tempo socioeconomic and security development program and ambitions for the energy sector, strategic minerals and metals mining, maritime shipping, and fisheries.1 One of Russia's key strategic goals is the transformation of the Arctic into the ""foremost strategic base for natural resources"" by 2020. The expansion of the energy sector, which is monopolized by the national oil companies Gazprom, Rosneft, and more recently Zarubezhneft, has been moving forward, although dogged by delays. Some plans, including one to develop the Shtokman gas field in the Barents Sea, were canceled after the U.S. shale gas revolution altered the geopolitics of energy.Another fundamental Russian goal in the Arctic is development of the Northern Sea Route (NSR) as a major shipping artery to challenge traditional trade lanes between Europe and Asia. The use of the route for both transit and destinational shipping has risen systematically since 2009, and the government has high expectations for the future.2 However, the development of the NSR depends on the scope of economic development in the Arctic, even as many Arctic development projects depend on the availability of the NSR. To make Arctic shipping easier and safer, Russia has embarked on a large-scale plan to revitalize the passage through legislative and economic means as well as the use of security and military assets. Plans include construction of a new generation of icebreakers, modernization of search-and-rescue services, management of communications, development of navigation and surveillance systems, and development of a comprehensive dual-use coastal infrastructure that would serve Russian military and civilian purposes alike.As the Arctic becomes more accessible and the number of states and organizations active in it grows sharply, the region is seen by many in Russia as increasingly vulnerable. …","Asian Interests in the Arctic: Risks and Gains for Russia In recent years, the Arctic has become a key area of interest for Russian domestic and foreign policymakers.

168,168,Scientific assessments: Matching the process to the problem,2017,"Background : The science–policy interface process – known as a ‘scientific assessment’ – has risen to prominence in the past few decades. Complex assessments are appropriate for issues which are both technically complicated, multifaceted and of high societal interest. There is increasing interest from the research community that studies biological invasions to undertake such an assessment. Objectives : Providing the relevant background and context, the article describes key principles and steps for designing, planning, resourcing and executing such a process, as well as providing evidence of high-impact assessments enhancing scientific careers. Method : Experience from international and national assessments, most recently the South African scientific assessment for the Shale Gas Development in the Central Karoo, was used to develop this guiding generic template for practitioners. Analyses of researcher publication performances were undertaken to determine the benefit of being involved in assessments. Results : The key success factors for assessments mostly relate to adherence to ‘process’ and ‘governance’ aspects, for which scientists are sometimes ill-equipped. As regards publication outputs, authors involved in assessment processes demonstrated higher H-indices than their environmental scientist peers. We have suggested causal explanations for this. Conclusion : Effectively designed and managed assessments provide the platform for the ‘co-production of knowledge’ – an iterative and collaborative process involving scientists, stakeholders and policymakers. This increases scientific impact in the society–policy domain. While scientists seem concerned that effort directed towards assessments comes at the detriment of scientific credibility and productivity, we have presented data that suggest the opposite.","Scientific assessments: Matching the process to the problem Background : The science–policy interface process – known as a ‘scientific assessment’ – has risen to prominence in the past few decades.
